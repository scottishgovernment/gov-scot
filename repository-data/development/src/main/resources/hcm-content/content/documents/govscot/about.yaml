          <p>The Scottish Government runs the country in relation to matters that are devolved from Westminster.</p>

          <p>This includes: the economy, education, health, justice, rural affairs, housing, environment, equal opportunities, consumer advocacy and advice, transport and taxation. The power to set a Scottish rate of income tax is a new addition to our responsibilities and further powers will be devolved to Scotland over the coming years.</p>

          <h2>The Scottish Parliament</h2>

          <p>Government is separate from parliament. The Scottish Parliament is made up of all elected members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and is the law making body for devolved matters. It considers any proposed legislation and scrutinises the activities and policies of the Scottish Government through debates, parliamentary questions and the work of committees.</p>

          <p>If you are looking to find out about MSPs you can find this information on the <a href="https://www.parliament.scot">Scottish Parliament</a> website.</p>

          <h2>National Performance Framework</h2>

          <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"><span><span><span>The National Performance Framework sets an overall purpose and vision for Scotland. It highlights the broad national outcomes that support the purpose and provides measures on how well Scotland is progressing towards them.</span></span></span></p>

          <p>Find out more about the <a href="http://nationalperformance.gov.scot/">National Performance Framework</a>.</p>

          <h2>Programme for Government</h2>

          <p>The annual <a href="programme-for-government">Programme for Government</a> sets out the policies, actions and legislation that we will take forward each year.</p>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>A policy is a statement of what the government is trying to achieve and how it will do it. Policies describe the work the Scottish Government is doing to achieve its strategic objectives.</p>

          <h2>Legislation</h2>

          <p>A bill is a proposal for a new law or a major change to an existing one. Most bills are introduced to the Scottish Parliament by the Scottish Government and the process begins with the formulation of policy by the government.</p>

          <p>A bill becomes law once it is agreed by the Scottish Parliament and then by The King. From then on it becomes known as an act.</p>

          <p>Find out <a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/30590.aspx">more about bills on the Scottish Parliament website</a>. You can also find a list of current bills going through parliament.</p>

          <p>Once an act is in place, subordinate legislation, mostly in the form of Scottish statutory instruments (SSIs) is needed to start it working and add the fine details which make it operate correctly.</p>

          <p>Details of all legislation in the UK is available on <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/">legislation.gov.uk</a>.</p>

          <h2>Statistics</h2>

          <p>Government produces official statistics about most areas of public life. Statistics are used by people to make informed decisions and to measure the success of government policies and services.</p>

          <p>You can <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics">find out how official statistics are produced and published</a> by the Scottish Government and other bodies.</p>

          <h2>Transparency</h2>

          <p>The government publishes information about how government works to allow you to make politicians, public services and public organisations more accountable. We are committed to publishing information about:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>how much public money has been spent on what</li>
           <li>the job titles of senior civil servants and how much they are paid</li>
           <li>how the government is doing against its objectives, via the National Performance Framework (see below)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Freedom of information (FOI)</h2>

          <p>The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 gives you the right to ask any public sector organisation for recorded information.</p>

              <p>The Scotland Act 1998 requires the First Minister to be a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) – appointed by the Monarch following a vote by fellow MSPs to nominate the individual.</p>

              <h2>First Ministers</h2>

              <h3>Humza Yousaf</h3>

              <p>2023 to present</p>

              <h3>Nicola Sturgeon</h3>

              <p>2014 to 2023</p>

              <h3>Alex Salmond</h3>

              <p>2007 to 2014</p>

              <h3>Jack McConnell</h3>

              <p>2001 to 2007</p>

              <h3>Henry McLeish</h3>

              <p>2000 to 2001</p>

              <h3>Donald Dewar</h3>

              <p>1999 to 2000</p>

              <p>Following devolution in 1999, powers held by the UK Government transferred to the Scottish Parliament and to Scottish Ministers. Scottish Ministers are responsible for key policy areas in Scotland including education, justice, health, aspects of the economy and social justice.</p>

              <p>The First Minister – also following the agreement of the Parliament – recommends to the Monarch the appointment of the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General (the 'law officers'). They are also members of the Scottish Government and, together with cabinet secretaries and junior ministers are collectively known as the 'Scottish ministers'.</p>

              <p>The First Minister is also responsible for nominating judges for appointment by the Monarch, including the Lord President of the Court of Session and Lord Justice Clerk, following the recommendation of the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland.</p>

              <p>Scottish ministers, including the First Minister, are accountable to the Scottish Parliament for the policy and actions of the Scottish Government. As an MSP, any minister including the First Minister, may take part in debates or vote in the main chamber of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

              <p><a href="index" title="Bute House">Bute House</a>&nbsp;also transferred from the office of Scottish Secretary to the office of the First Minister as the office-holder’s official residence in Edinburgh.</p>

              <p>The Scotland Act 1998 requires the First Minister to be a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) – appointed by the Monarch following a vote by fellow MSPs to nominate the individual.</p>

              <h2>First Ministers</h2>

              <h3>Humza Yousaf</h3>

              <p>2023 to present</p>

              <h3>Nicola Sturgeon</h3>

              <h3>Alex Salmond</h3>

              <h3>Jack McConnell</h3>

              <h3>Henry McLeish</h3>

              <h3>Donald Dewar</h3>

              <p>1999 to 2000</p>

              <p>Following devolution in 1999, powers held by the UK Government transferred to the Scottish Parliament and to Scottish Ministers. Scottish Ministers are responsible for key policy areas in Scotland including education, justice, health, aspects of the economy and social justice.</p>

              <p>The First Minister – also following the agreement of the Parliament – recommends to the Monarch the appointment of the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General (the 'law officers'). They are also members of the Scottish Government and, together with cabinet secretaries and junior ministers are collectively known as the 'Scottish ministers'.</p>

              <p>The First Minister is also responsible for nominating judges for appointment by the Monarch, including the Lord President of the Court of Session and Lord Justice Clerk, following the recommendation of the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland.</p>

              <p>Scottish ministers, including the First Minister, are accountable to the Scottish Parliament for the policy and actions of the Scottish Government. As an MSP, any minister including the First Minister, may take part in debates or vote in the main chamber of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

His work at the university was interrupted with two years on secondment to the University of Edinburgh (2002-2003 at the Centre for Families and Relationships).&nbsp;</p>

              <p>His route to higher education was through Carmyle Primary School (Glasgow), Pennyburn Primary and Kilwinning Academy (North Ayrshire). He studied Geography at the University of Strathclyde, before heading across the city to complete a PhD at the University of Glasgow. Technically, the first in his family to go to university, he prefers to credit that family milestone to his mum who gained a teaching degree as a mature student at Craigie College of Education (now the University of the West of Scotland).</p>

              <p>He is on the Child Poverty Programme Board and Scottish Attainment Challenge Programme Board and serves as a committee member on a number of anti-poverty initiatives and organisations.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The government in Scotland is structured into a number of directorates. Directorates and their related public bodies are responsible for putting government policy into practice.</p>

            <h2>The Civil Service</h2>

            <div class="stat-boxes"><a href="permanent-secretary" class="stat-box"><span class="stat-box__value">1</span><span class="stat-box__label"><span class="stat-box__label-text">Permanent Secretary</span></span></a> <a href="civil-service" class="stat-box"><span class="stat-box__value">8</span><span class="stat-box__label"><span class="stat-box__label-text">Directors General</span></span></a> <a href="directorates" class="stat-box"><span class="stat-box__value">30+</span><span class="stat-box__label"><span class="stat-box__label-text">Directorates</span></span></a></div>

            <p>The Permanent Secretary is the senior civil servant in Scotland and leads the 7,000-plus people working for the Scottish Government. The Permanent Secretary supports the government in developing, implementing and communicating its policies.</p>

            <p>The current <a href="permanent-secretary">Permanent Secretary</a> of the Scottish Government is John-Paul Marks. He is the principal policy adviser to the First Minister and Secretary to the Scottish Cabinet. He is also the principal accountable officer with responsibility to ensure that the government's money and resources are used effectively and properly.</p>

            <h2>Directors-general and directorates</h2>

            <p>There are eight&nbsp;directors-general who head up the <a href="civil-service">Scottish civil service</a>. A director-general manages a number of <a href="directorates">directorates</a> and agencies which are responsible for proposing legislation and putting Scottish Government policy into practice.</p>

            <h2>Public bodies</h2>

            <p>Non-ministerial departments are headed by senior civil servants and not ministers. They usually have a regulatory or inspection function like the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.</p>

            <p>Executive agencies are part of the Scottish Government and generally have a strong focus on the management and direct delivery of public services, but can also provide strategic policy input.</p>

            <p>Executive non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) carry out administrative, commercial, executive or regulatory functions on behalf of government.</p>

            <p>Advisory NDPBs provide independent expert advice to ministers and others or input into the policy-making process in relation to particular subjects.</p>

            <p>Tribunals are responsible for tasks and advice relating to specialist areas of the law and carry out judicial functions such as determining the rights and obligations of private citizens, although they are not part of the court system.</p>

            <p>Public corporations are industrial or commercial enterprises under direct government control.</p>

            <p>Health bodies comprise 14 regional health boards, eight special health boards and the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland.</p>

            <p>There are 32 local authorities (councils) in Scotland.</p>

            <p>The Permanent Secretary is the senior civil servant in Scotland and leads the 7,000-plus people working for the Scottish Government. The Permanent Secretary supports the government in developing, implementing and communicating its policies.</p>

            <p>The current <a href="permanent-secretary">Permanent Secretary</a> of the Scottish Government is John-Paul Marks.

            <p>Non-ministerial departments are headed by senior civil servants and not ministers. They usually have a regulatory or inspection function like the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.</p>

            <p>Executive agencies are part of the Scottish Government and generally have a strong focus on the management and direct delivery of public services, but can also provide strategic policy input.</p>

            <p>Executive non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) carry out administrative, commercial, executive or regulatory functions on behalf of government.</p>

            <p>Advisory NDPBs provide independent expert advice to ministers and others or input into the policy-making process in relation to particular subjects.</p>

            <p>Tribunals are responsible for tasks and advice relating to specialist areas of the law and carry out judicial functions such as determining the rights and obligations of private citizens, although they are not part of the court system.</p>

            <p>Public corporations are industrial or commercial enterprises under direct government control.</p>

            <p>Health bodies comprise 14 regional health boards, eight special health boards and the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland.</p>

            <h2>The Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations</h2>

            <p>These regulations came into force from 18 July 2015 and establish the UK framework for the re-use of public sector information.&nbsp;The purpose is to make information easier to re-use, resulting in economic, social and civil benefits.&nbsp;They are an update to earlier regulations which encouraged public sector organisations to make information available for re-use.&nbsp; The 2015 regulations go further, and make it mandatory to make information available for re-use.</p>

            <h3>Public sector information</h3>

            <p>Public sector information is any information created by a public sector organisation in undertaking their public task.&nbsp;We have&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="index">statement of public task</a> ,&nbsp;that describes this for potential re-users.</p>

            <h3>Re-use</h3>

            <p>Re-use means use for any purpose other than that for which the information was originally produced.</p>

            <h3>Find out more</h3>

            <p>The National Archives has published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/regulations/">Guidance and Best Practice Advice</a>&nbsp;on the regulations for public sector organisations and potential re-users.</p>

            <h3>Information&nbsp;the Scottish Government has&nbsp;available for re-use</h3>

            <p>As information assets become available for re-use they will be added to the Re-use Register.</p>

            <p>In addition, section 23 of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 requires that all Scottish public authorities maintain a publication scheme setting out the types of information that are routinely made available.&nbsp;For more details on our&nbsp;publication scheme, see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/guide-to-information/">Guide to Information</a>. Information published under our publication scheme can be made available for re-use.</p>

            \ Public Sector Information Regulations</h2> \n  <p>These regulations\
            \ came into force from 18 July 2015 and establish the UK framework for\
            \ the re-use of public sector information.&nbsp;The purpose is to make\
            \ information easier to re-use, resulting in economic, social and civil\
            \ benefits.&nbsp;They are an update to earlier regulations which encouraged\
            \ public sector organisations to make information available for re-use.&nbsp;\
            \ The 2015 regulations go further, and make it mandatory to make information\
            \ available for re-use.</p> \n  <h3>Public sector information</h3> \n\
            \  <p>Public sector information is any information created by a public\
            \ sector organisation in undertaking their public task.&nbsp;We have&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a\
            \ href=\"index\">statement of public task</a> ,&nbsp;that describes this\
            \ for potential re-users.</p> \n  <h3>Re-use</h3> \n  <p>Re-use means\
            \ use for any purpose other than that for which the information was originally\
            \ produced.</p> \n  <h3>Find out more</h3> \n  <p>The National Archives\

            >Guidance and Best Practice Advice</a>&nbsp;on the regulations for public\
            \ sector organisations and potential re-users.</p> \n  <h3>Information&nbsp;the\
            \ Scottish Government has&nbsp;available for re-use</h3> \n  <p>As information\
            \ assets become available for re-use they will be added to the Re-use\
            \ Register.</p> \n  <p>In addition, section 23 of the Freedom of Information\
            \ (Scotland) Act 2002 requires that all Scottish public authorities maintain\
            \ a publication scheme setting out the types of information that are routinely\
            \ made available.&nbsp;For more details on our&nbsp;publication scheme,\

            <p>If something goes wrong or you are dissatisfied with our service, please tell us. We will work with you to resolve it.</p>

            <h2>What you can complain about</h2>

            <p>You can complain about things like:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>delays in responding to your enquiries and requests</li>
             <li>failure to provide a service</li>
             <li>our standard of service</li>
             <li>our policy</li>
             <li>treatment by, or attitude of, a member of staff</li>
             <li>our failure to follow proper procedure</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your complaint may involve more than one service or be about someone working on our behalf.</p>

            <p>There are some things we can't deal with through our complaints handling procedure.</p>

            <p>These include:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>a routine first-time request for a service, for example, local services, transport, housing, health provision</li>
             <li>requests for compensation from external organisations</li>
             <li>things that are covered by a right of appeal, for example, planning and related appeal decisions</li>
             <li>Freedom of Information or Environmental Information request decisions</li>
             <li>legal proceedings or judgements</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If other procedures or rights of appeal can help you resolve your concerns, we will give information and advice to help you.</p>

            <h2>Get help to make a complaint</h2>

            <p>Anyone can make a complaint to us, including the representatives of someone who is dissatisfied with our service.</p>

            <p>There may be reasons why you are unable, or reluctant, to make a complaint yourself. We can take complaints from a friend, relative, or an advocate, if you have given them your consent to complain for you.</p>

            <p>You can find out about advocates in your area by contacting the <a href="http://www.siaa.org.uk">Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance</a>.</p>

            <h2>Timescales to complain</h2>

            <p>Normally, you must make your complaint within six months of the event.</p>

            <p>However, if you do not find out that you have a reason to complain until later, you can lodge a complaint up to 12 months after the event itself.</p>

            <p>In exceptional circumstances we may be able to accept a complaint after the time limit. If you feel that the time limit should not apply to your complaint, please tell us why.</p>

            <h2>What happens when you complain</h2>

            <p>We will always tell you who is dealing with your complaint.</p>

            <p>Our complaints handling procedure has three stages.</p>

            <h3>1. How to complain: frontline resolution</h3>

            <p>Contact staff in the area responsible for the service which has caused you concern.</p>

            <p>You can find the right person to talk to by:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>checking our list of <a href="contact-information">contact points</a></li>
             <li>emailing <a href="mailto:sgcomplaints@gov.scot">sgcomplaints@gov.scot</a></li>
             <li>writing to Scottish Government, Complaints, 1E.10, St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, EH1 3DG</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We aim to resolve your complaint informally within five working days.</p>

            <p>If we can't resolve the issue, you can take your complaint to stage two of the complaints procedure.</p>

            <h3>2. If you are not satisfied: investigation</h3>

            <p>An Investigating Officer will be appointed to prepare a comprehensive report and, if we have got things wrong, will recommend improvements.</p>

            <p>We will:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>acknowledge receipt of your complaint within three working days</li>
             <li>where appropriate, discuss the complaint with you to understand why you remain dissatisfied and what outcome you are looking for</li>
             <li>give you a full response as soon as possible and within 20 working days</li>

            <p>If something goes wrong or you are dissatisfied with our service, please tell us. We will work with you to resolve it.</p>

            <h2>What you can complain about</h2>

            <p>You can complain about things like:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>delays in responding to your enquiries and requests</li>
             <li>failure to provide a service</li>
             <li>our standard of service</li>
             <li>our policy</li>
             <li>treatment by, or attitude of, a member of staff</li>
             <li>our failure to follow proper procedure</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your complaint may involve more than one service or be about someone working on our behalf.</p>

            <p>There are some things we can't deal with through our complaints handling procedure.</p>

            <p>These include:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>a routine first-time request for a service, for example, local services, transport, housing, health provision</li>
             <li>requests for compensation from external organisations</li>
             <li>things that are covered by a right of appeal, for example, planning and related appeal decisions</li>
             <li>Freedom of Information or Environmental Information request decisions</li>
             <li>legal proceedings or judgements</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If other procedures or rights of appeal can help you resolve your concerns, we will give information and advice to help you.</p>

            <h2>Get help to make a complaint</h2>

            <p>Anyone can make a complaint to us, including the representatives of someone who is dissatisfied with our service.</p>

            <p>There may be reasons why you are unable, or reluctant, to make a complaint yourself. We can take complaints from a friend, relative, or an advocate, if you have given them your consent to complain for you.</p>

            <p>You can find out about advocates in your area by contacting the <a href="http://www.siaa.org.uk">Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance</a>.</p>

            <h2>Timescales to complain</h2>

            <p>Normally, you must make your complaint within six months of the event.</p>

            <p>However, if you do not find out that you have a reason to complain until later, you can lodge a complaint up to 12 months after the event itself.</p>

            <p>In exceptional circumstances we may be able to accept a complaint after the time limit. If you feel that the time limit should not apply to your complaint, please tell us why.</p>

            <h2>What happens when you complain</h2>

            <p>We will always tell you who is dealing with your complaint.</p>

            <p>Our complaints handling procedure has three stages.</p>

            <h3>1. How to complain: frontline resolution</h3>

            <p>Contact staff in the area responsible for the service which has caused you concern.</p>

            <p>You can find the right person to talk to by:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>checking our list of <a href="contact-information">contact points</a></li>
             <li>emailing <a href="mailto:sgcomplaints@gov.scot">sgcomplaints@gov.scot</a></li>
             <li>writing to Scottish Government, Complaints, 1E.10, St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, EH1 3DG</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We aim to resolve your complaint informally within five working days.</p>

            <p>If we can't resolve the issue, you can take your complaint to stage two of the complaints procedure.</p>

            <h3>2. If you are not satisfied: investigation</h3>

            <p>An Investigating Officer will be appointed to prepare a comprehensive report and, if we have got things wrong, will recommend improvements.</p>

            <p>We will:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>acknowledge receipt of your complaint within three working days</li>
             <li>where appropriate, discuss the complaint with you to understand why you remain dissatisfied and what outcome you are looking for</li>
             <li>give you a full response as soon as possible and within 20 working days</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will tell you if our investigation will take longer and will agree revised time limits with you.</p>

            <p>After we have fully investigated and you remain dissatisfied, you then have the option of asking the Scottish Public Service Ombudsman (SPSO) to investigate your complaint.</p>

            <p>If something goes wrong or you are dissatisfied with our service, please tell us. We will work with you to resolve it.</p>

            <h2>What you can complain about</h2>

            <p>You can complain about things like:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>delays in responding to your enquiries and requests</li>
             <li>failure to provide a service</li>
             <li>our standard of service</li>
             <li>our policy</li>
             <li>treatment by, or attitude of, a member of staff</li>
             <li>our failure to follow proper procedure</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your complaint may involve more than one service or be about someone working on our behalf.</p>

            <p>There are some things we can't deal with through our complaints handling procedure.</p>

            <p>These include:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>a routine first-time request for a service, for example, local services, transport, housing, health provision</li>
             <li>requests for compensation from external organisations</li>
             <li>things that are covered by a right of appeal, for example, planning and related appeal decisions</li>
             <li>Freedom of Information or Environmental Information request decisions</li>
             <li>legal proceedings or judgements</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If other procedures or rights of appeal can help you resolve your concerns, we will give information and advice to help you.</p>

            <h2>Get help to make a complaint</h2>

            <p>Anyone can make a complaint to us, including the representatives of someone who is dissatisfied with our service.</p>

            <p>There may be reasons why you are unable, or reluctant, to make a complaint yourself. We can take complaints from a friend, relative, or an advocate, if you have given them your consent to complain for you.</p>

            <p>You can find out about advocates in your area by contacting the <a href="http://www.siaa.org.uk">Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance</a>.</p>

            <h2>Timescales to complain</h2>

            <p>Normally, you must make your complaint within six months of the event.</p>

            <p>However, if you do not find out that you have a reason to complain until later, you can lodge a complaint up to 12 months after the event itself.</p>

            <p>In exceptional circumstances we may be able to accept a complaint after the time limit. If you feel that the time limit should not apply to your complaint, please tell us why.</p>

            <h2>What happens when you complain</h2>

            <p>We will always tell you who is dealing with your complaint.</p>

            <p>Our complaints handling procedure has three stages.</p>

            <h3>1. How to complain: frontline resolution</h3>

            <p>Contact staff in the area responsible for the service which has caused you concern.</p>

            <p>You can find the right person to talk to by:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>checking our list of <a href="contact-information">contact points</a></li>
             <li>emailing <a href="mailto:sgcomplaints@gov.scot">sgcomplaints@gov.scot</a></li>
             <li>writing to Scottish Government, Complaints, 1E.10, St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, EH1 3DG</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We aim to resolve your complaint informally within five working days.</p>

            <p>If we can't resolve the issue, you can take your complaint to stage two of the complaints procedure.</p>

            <h3>2. If you are not satisfied: investigation</h3>

            <p>An Investigating Officer will be appointed to prepare a comprehensive report and, if we have got things wrong, will recommend improvements.</p>

            <p>We will:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>acknowledge receipt of your complaint within three working days</li>
             <li>where appropriate, discuss the complaint with you to understand why you remain dissatisfied and what outcome you are looking for</li>
             <li>give you a full response as soon as possible and within 20 working days</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will tell you if our investigation will take longer and will agree revised time limits with you.</p>

            <p>After we have fully investigated and you remain dissatisfied, you then have the option of asking the Scottish Public Service Ombudsman (SPSO) to investigate your complaint.</p>

            <h3>3. Independent investigation of your complaint: ombudsman</h3>

            <p>The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) is the final stage for complaints about public services in Scotland and may be able to independently take up a complaint on your behalf.</p>

            <p>The Ombudsman will normally only be able to act if you have followed the steps above.</p>

            <p><span><span><span><span><span>The SPSO’s contact details are:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

            <p><span><span><span><span><span>Scottish Public Services Ombudsman<br />

            99 McDonald Road<br />
            Edinburgh<br />
            EH7 4NS</span></span></span></span></span></p>

            <h3>Gàidhlig</h3>

            <h1>Cuiribh gearan thugainn</h1>

            <p>Ma thèid rudeigin ceàrr no mura bheil sibh riaraichte leis an t-seirbheis againn, cuiribh fios thugainn. Obraichidh sinn còmhla ribh gus fuasgladh fhaighinn.</p>

            <h2>Dè an seorsa gearan a dh'fhaodar a chuir thugainn</h2>

            <p>Faodar gearan a chuir thugainn mu na cuspairean a leanas:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>dàil ann am freagairtean ri na ceistean agus iarrtasan agaibh</li>
             <li>nach deach seirbheis air choireigin a lìbhrigeadh ceart</li>
             <li>ìre na seirbheis againn</li>
             <li>na poileasaidhean againn</li>
             <li>mar a chaidh ur làimhseachadh le luchd-obrach</li>
             <li>nach deach dòighean-obrach ceart a leantail</li>
            </ul>

            <p>'S dòcha gum bi gearan agaibh mu dheidhinn barrachd is aon seirbheis, neo mu dheidhinn cuideigin eile a tha ag obair às ar leth.</p>

            <p>Tha cùisean ann ris nach urrainn dhuinn dèiligeadh tron phròiseas gearain</p>

            <p>Nam measg tha na cùisean a leanas:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>iarrtas sìmplidh airson seirbheis airson a' chiad uair, mar eisimpleir seirbheisean ionadail, còmhdhail, taigheadas, solar slàinte</li>
             <li>iarrtasan airson dìoladh bho bhuidhnean air leth bhon riaghaltas</li>
             <li>cùisean far a bheil còir ath-thagraidh ann, mar eisimpleir, planadh agus dearbhaidhean ath-thagraidh co-cheangailte ris</li>
             <li>dearbhaidhean a thaobh Saorsa an Fhiosrachaidh no Fiosrachadh Àrainneachdail</li>
             <li>cùisean no breithean lagha</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ma tha modhan-obrach no còirichean ath-thagraidh a dh'fhaodadh ur cuideachadh gus fuasgladh fhaighinn, bheir sinn seachad fiosrachadh agus comhairle gus ur cuideachadh.</p>

            <h2>Faigh cuideachadh gus gearan a chuir thugainn</h2>

            <p>Faodaidh duine sam bith gearan a chuir thugainn, a' gabhail a-steach riochdairean airson cuideigein nach eil riaraichte leis an t-seirbheis againn.</p>

            <p>'S dòcha gum bi adhbharan ann nach urrainn dhut fhèin, no nach eil sibh fhèin airson, gearan a chuir thugainn. Faodaidh sinn gearanan a chluinntinn bho charaidean, bho chàirdean, no bho neach-tagraidh eile, ma tha sibh air cead a thoirt dhaibh gearan a chuir thugainn às ur leth.</p>

            <p>Gheibh sibh fiosrachadh mu dheidhinn luchd-tagraidh san sgìre agaibh fhèin bho <a href="http://www.siaa.org.uk">Chaidreachas Tagraidh Neo-eisimileach na h-Alba</a>.</p>

            <h2>Raon-ama airson gearan a chuir thugainn</h2>

            <p>Mar as trice, feumaidh sibh gearan a chuir thugainn taobh a-steach sia mìosan às deidh dhan tachartas. Mura bheil fios agaibh gu bheil adhbhar gearain agaibh aig an àm, ge-tà, faodaidh sibh gearan a chuir thugainn suas ri 12 mìosan às deidh dhan tachartas fhèin.</p>

            <p>Ma tha suidheachadh air leth ann 's dòcha gun urrainn dhuinn gearan a chluinntinn às deidh don cheann-là a dhol seachad. Mura bheil sibh a' smaointinn gum bu chòir dhuinn ur gearan a chluinntinn às deidh dhan cheann-là, innsibh dhuinn carson.</p>

            <h2>Dè thachras nuair a chuireas sibh gearan thugainn</h2>

            <p>Innsidh sinn dhuibh cò a tha a' dèiligeadh ris an gearan agaibh.</p>
