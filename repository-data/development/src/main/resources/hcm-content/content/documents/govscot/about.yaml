          <p>The Scottish Government runs the country in relation to matters that are devolved from Westminster.</p>

          <p>This includes: the economy, education, health, justice, rural affairs, housing, environment, equal opportunities, consumer advocacy and advice, transport and taxation. The power to set a Scottish rate of income tax is a new addition to our responsibilities and further powers will be devolved to Scotland over the coming years.</p>

          <h2>The Scottish Parliament</h2>

          <p>Government is separate from parliament. The Scottish Parliament is made up of all elected members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and is the law making body for devolved matters. It considers any proposed legislation and scrutinises the activities and policies of the Scottish Government through debates, parliamentary questions and the work of committees.</p>

          <p>If you are looking to find out about MSPs you can find this information on the <a href="https://www.parliament.scot">Scottish Parliament</a> website.</p>

          <h2>National Performance Framework</h2>

          <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"><span><span><span>The National Performance Framework sets an overall purpose and vision for Scotland. It highlights the broad national outcomes that support the purpose and provides measures on how well Scotland is progressing towards them.</span></span></span></p>

          <p>Find out more about the <a href="http://nationalperformance.gov.scot/">National Performance Framework</a>.</p>

          <h2>Programme for Government</h2>

          <p>The annual <a href="programme-for-government">Programme for Government</a> sets out the policies, actions and legislation that we will take forward each year.</p>

          <h2>Policy</h2>

          <p>A policy is a statement of what the government is trying to achieve and how it will do it. Policies describe the work the Scottish Government is doing to achieve its strategic objectives.</p>

          <h2>Legislation</h2>

          <p>A bill is a proposal for a new law or a major change to an existing one. Most bills are introduced to the Scottish Parliament by the Scottish Government and the process begins with the formulation of policy by the government.</p>

          <p>A bill becomes law once it is agreed by the Scottish Parliament and then by The Queen. From then on it becomes known as an act.</p>

          <p>Find out <a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/30590.aspx">more about bills on the Scottish Parliament website</a>. You can also find a list of current bills going through parliament.</p>

          <p>Once an act is in place, subordinate legislation, mostly in the form of Scottish statutory instruments (SSIs) is needed to start it working and add the fine details which make it operate correctly.</p>

          <p>Details of all legislation in the UK is available on <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/">legislation.gov.uk</a>.</p>

          <h2>Statistics</h2>

          <p>Government produces official statistics about most areas of public life. Statistics are used by people to make informed decisions and to measure the success of government policies and services.</p>

          <p>You can <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics">find out how official statistics are produced and published</a> by the Scottish Government and other bodies.</p>

          <h2>Transparency</h2>

          <p>The government publishes information about how government works to allow you to make politicians, public services and public organisations more accountable. We are committed to publishing information about:</p>

          <ul>

           <li>the job titles of senior civil servants and how much they are paid</li>
           <li>how the government is doing against its objectives, via the National Performance Framework (see below)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Freedom of information (FOI)</h2>

          <p>The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 gives you the right to ask any public sector organisation for recorded information.</p>

          <p>Anyone can make a request for information – known as a freedom of information (FOI) request. There are no restrictions on age, nationality or where you live.</p>

              <p>The Scotland Act 1998 requires the First Minister to be a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) – appointed by the Monarch following a vote by fellow MSPs to nominate the individual.</p>

              <h2>First Ministers</h2>

              <h3>Nicola Sturgeon</h3>

              <p>2014 to present</p>

              <h3>Alex Salmond</h3>

              <p>2007 to 2014</p>

              <h3>Jack McConnell</h3>

              <p>2001 to 2007</p>

              <h3>Henry McLeish</h3>

              <p>2000 to 2001</p>

              <h3>Donald Dewar</h3>

              <p>1999 to 2000</p>

              <p>Following devolution in 1999, powers held by the UK Government transferred to the Scottish Parliament and to Scottish Ministers. Scottish Ministers are responsible for key policy areas in Scotland including education, justice, health, aspects of the economy and social justice.</p>

              <p>The First Minister – also following the agreement of the Parliament – recommends to the Monarch the appointment of the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General (the 'law officers'). They are also members of the Scottish Government and, together with cabinet secretaries and junior ministers are collectively known as the 'Scottish ministers'.</p>

              <p>The First Minister is also responsible for nominating judges for appointment by the Monarch, including the Lord President of the Court of Session and Lord Justice Clerk, following the recommendation of the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland.</p>

              <p>Scottish ministers, including the First Minister, are accountable to the Scottish Parliament for the policy and actions of the Scottish Government. As an MSP, any minister including the First Minister, may take part in debates or vote in the main chamber of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

              <p><a href="index" title="Bute House">Bute House</a>&nbsp;also transferred from the office of Scottish Secretary to the office of the First Minister as the office-holder’s official residence in Edinburgh.</p>

              <p>The Scotland Act 1998 requires the First Minister to be a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) – appointed by the Monarch following a vote by fellow MSPs to nominate the individual.</p>

              <h3>Nicola Sturgeon</h3>

              <p>2014 to present</p>

              <p>Scottish ministers, including the First Minister, are accountable to the Scottish Parliament for the policy and actions of the Scottish Government.

              <p><span><span><span>Rt Hon Dorothy&nbsp;Bain QC was appointed Lord Advocate in June 2021. </span></span></span></p>

              <p><span><span><span>Dorothy&nbsp;has extensive experience in both civil and criminal law. She qualified at the University of Aberdeen and began her career as an Advocate&nbsp;in 1994, taking silk in 2007. She has been instructed in cases at all levels, including the Court of Session (Inner and Outer House), Court of Criminal Appeal, High Court of Justiciary, United Kingdom Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights.</span></span></span></p>

              <p><span><span><span>From 2002 to 2011&nbsp;Dorothy served as an Advocate&nbsp;Depute in Crown Office. This culminated in her appointment as the Principal&nbsp;Advocate&nbsp;Depute in 2009; the first woman to be appointed to this post. As Principal&nbsp;Advocate&nbsp;Depute,&nbsp;Dorothy&nbsp;was Scotland’s most senior prosecutor, conducting many complex and high profile criminal prosecutions and appeals.

                <h2>What we do</h2>

                <p>We are taking forward a Programme for Government commitment to establish a <a href="https://www.gov.scot/policies/economic-growth/scottish-national-investment-bank/">Scottish National Investment Bank</a> (SNIB) which will become a cornerstone of Scotland’s economy. The Directorate is overseeing the Bank Implementation Plan which sets out&nbsp;proposals and recommendations for the establishment of the Bank. The Bank will&nbsp;provide patient mission-based finance, which will help create and shape future markets and help Scotland achieve its full economic potential.<em> </em>Key principles which underpin our approach to the Bank include being operationally and administratively independent from ministers, operating commercially, and delivering against missions which ministers will set for it. The Bank will provide finance for businesses through every stage of their investment lifecycle.</p>

                <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">We are responsible for:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>introducing the Scottish National Investment Bank Bill to the Scottish Parliament in early 2019 and progressing the Bill through parliamentary stages</li>
                 <li>publishing the Bank’s Articles of Association, strategic framework and impact assessments</li>
                 <li>developing advice for ministers on the scope and scale of the Bank, potential governance structures and investment activity including possible missions</li>
                 <li>providing policy advice to ministers on delivery of the Programme for Government commitment to a <a href="https://www.gov.scot/policies/supporting-business/finance/">Scottish Growth Scheme</a> investing £500m in businesses by June 2020, working with other public and private sector stakeholders</li>
                 <li>developing and delivering the £150 million <a href="https://www.gov.scot/policies/economic-growth/building-scotland-fund/">Building Scotland Fund (BSF)</a>, a precursor to the Bank which will provide loan or equity finance to&nbsp; boost house building across all tenures, develop modern low carbon industrial and commercial space and support business-led research and development projects with a reasonably realistic prospect of commercialisation</li>

The Directorate is overseeing the Bank Implementation Plan which sets out&nbsp;proposals and recommendations for the establishment of the Bank. The Bank will&nbsp;provide patient mission-based finance, which will help create and shape future markets and help Scotland achieve its full economic potential.<em> </em>Key principles which underpin our approach to the Bank include being operationally and administratively independent from ministers, operating commercially, and delivering against missions which ministers will set for it. The Bank will provide finance for businesses through every stage of their investment lifecycle.</p>

                <p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">We are responsible for:</p>

                 <li>developing advice for ministers on the scope and scale of the Bank, potential governance structures and investment activity including possible missions</li>

                <p>Formed in March 2021, it will support our pursuit of a wellbeing economy by:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>brigading together divisions across DG Economy to help businesses and workers operate safely</li>
                 <li>supporting those unable to operate because of government actions</li>
                 <li>evaluating&nbsp;and intervening&nbsp;where necessary in businesses of strategic importance</li>
                 <li>managing&nbsp;our investments in businesses efficiently</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This will ensure that our economic interventions are principled, purposeful and rooted in evidence.</p>

                <p>The work of the directorate is crucial to our economic resilience and will chart a course towards economic recovery necessitated by the pandemic. Given its critical importance and the scale of budget (c.£1bn), we expect the directorate to grow to meet the ambitions of ministers on this agenda.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This will ensure that our economic interventions are principled, purposeful and rooted in evidence.</p>

                <p>The work of the directorate is crucial to our economic resilience and will chart a course towards economic recovery necessitated by the pandemic. Given its critical importance and the scale of budget (c.£1bn), we expect the directorate to grow to meet the ambitions of ministers on this agenda.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>

                <p>The Director of Fair Work is responsible for developing policies and approaches to improve productivity and reduce inequality and ensure that, in Scotland, work improves people's lives.</p>

                <h3>Biography</h3>

                <p>In the absence of Dominic Munro, who is currently leading the Scottish Government’s exit strategy from the Covid-19 pandemic, David Wilson has taken up the post as interim director of the Fair Work, Employability and Skills Directorate. This change was effective from April 2020.</p>

                <p>David returned to the Scottish Government as Programme Director for the Scottish National Investment Bank in July 2018, after three years as Executive Director of the International Public Policy Institute at the University of Strathclyde. While outside Government, David was Chair of the Safe Deposits Scotland Trust and appointed as a Commissioner on the Scottish Fiscal Commission.</p>

                <p>His previous posts within the Scottish Government include:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>Director of Communications and Ministerial Support</li>
                 <li>Director of Energy</li>
                 <li>Director of Business and Enterprise</li>
                </ul>

                <p>David was born in Hamilton, and was brought up in Strathaven. He attended Strathaven Academy and then Larkhall Academy and has lived in Edinburgh since 1981, initially as a student at Edinburgh University. He is married with three grown-up children.</p>

            <p>The government in Scotland is structured into a number of directorates. Directorates and their related public bodies are responsible for putting government policy into practice.</p>

            <h2>The Civil Service</h2>

            <div class="stat-boxes"><a href="permanent-secretary" class="stat-box"><span class="stat-box__value">1</span><span class="stat-box__label"><span class="stat-box__label-text">Permanent Secretary</span></span></a> <a href="civil-service" class="stat-box"><span class="stat-box__value">8</span><span class="stat-box__label"><span class="stat-box__label-text">Directors General</span></span></a> <a href="directorates" class="stat-box"><span class="stat-box__value">30+</span><span class="stat-box__label"><span class="stat-box__label-text">Directorates</span></span></a></div>

            <p>The Permanent Secretary is the senior civil servant in Scotland and leads the 7,000-plus people working for the Scottish Government. The Permanent Secretary supports the government in developing, implementing and communicating its policies.</p>

            <p>The current <a href="permanent-secretary">Permanent Secretary</a> of the Scottish Government is John-Paul Marks. He is the principal policy adviser to the First Minister and Secretary to the Scottish Cabinet. He is also the principal accountable officer with responsibility to ensure that the government's money and resources are used effectively and properly.</p>

            <h2>Directors-general and directorates</h2>

            <p>There are eight&nbsp;directors-general who head up the <a href="civil-service">Scottish civil service</a>. A director-general manages a number of <a href="directorates">directorates</a> and agencies which are responsible for proposing legislation and putting Scottish Government policy into practice.</p>

            <h2>Public bodies</h2>

            <p>Non-ministerial departments are headed by senior civil servants and not ministers. They usually have a regulatory or inspection function like the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.</p>

            <p>Executive agencies are part of the Scottish Government and generally have a strong focus on the management and direct delivery of public services, but can also provide strategic policy input.</p>

            <p>Executive non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) carry out administrative, commercial, executive or regulatory functions on behalf of government.</p>

            <p>Advisory NDPBs provide independent expert advice to ministers and others or input into the policy-making process in relation to particular subjects.</p>

            <p>Tribunals are responsible for tasks and advice relating to specialist areas of the law and carry out judicial functions such as determining the rights and obligations of private citizens, although they are not part of the court system.</p>

            <p>Public corporations are industrial or commercial enterprises under direct government control.</p>

            <p>Health bodies comprise 14 regional health boards, eight special health boards and the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland.</p>

            <p>There are 32 local authorities (councils) in Scotland.</p>

            <p>The government in Scotland is structured into a number of directorates. Directorates and their related public bodies are responsible for putting government policy into practice.</p>

            <h2>The Civil Service</h2>

            <div class="stat-boxes"><a href="permanent-secretary" class="stat-box"><span class="stat-box__value">1</span><span class="stat-box__label"><span class="stat-box__label-text">Permanent Secretary</span></span></a> <a href="civil-service" class="stat-box"><span class="stat-box__value">8</span><span class="stat-box__label"><span class="stat-box__label-text">Directors General</span></span></a> <a href="directorates" class="stat-box"><span class="stat-box__value">30+</span><span class="stat-box__label"><span class="stat-box__label-text">Directorates</span></span></a></div>

            <p>The Permanent Secretary is the senior civil servant in Scotland and leads the 7,000-plus people working for the Scottish Government. The Permanent Secretary supports the government in developing, implementing and communicating its policies.</p>

            <p>The current <a href="permanent-secretary">Permanent Secretary</a> of the Scottish Government is John-Paul Marks. He is the principal policy adviser to the First Minister and Secretary to the Scottish Cabinet. He is also the principal accountable officer with responsibility to ensure that the government's money and resources are used effectively and properly.</p>

            <h2>Directors-general and directorates</h2>

            <p>There are eight&nbsp;directors-general who head up the <a href="civil-service">Scottish civil service</a>. A director-general manages a number of <a href="directorates">directorates</a> and agencies which are responsible for proposing legislation and putting Scottish Government policy into practice.</p>

            <h2>Public bodies</h2>

            <p>Non-ministerial departments are headed by senior civil servants and not ministers. They usually have a regulatory or inspection function like the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.</p>

            <p>Executive agencies are part of the Scottish Government and generally have a strong focus on the management and direct delivery of public services, but can also provide strategic policy input.</p>

            <p>Executive non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) carry out administrative, commercial, executive or regulatory functions on behalf of government.</p>

            <p>Advisory NDPBs provide independent expert advice to ministers and others or input into the policy-making process in relation to particular subjects.</p>

            <p>Tribunals are responsible for tasks and advice relating to specialist areas of the law and carry out judicial functions such as determining the rights and obligations of private citizens, although they are not part of the court system.</p>

            <p>Public corporations are industrial or commercial enterprises under direct government control.</p>

            <p>Health bodies comprise 14 regional health boards, eight special health boards and the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland.</p>

            <p>There are 32 local authorities (councils) in Scotland.</p>

            </ul>

            <h2>The Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations</h2>

            <p>These regulations came into force from 18 July 2015 and establish the UK framework for the re-use of public sector information.&nbsp;The purpose is to make information easier to re-use, resulting in economic, social and civil benefits.&nbsp;They are an update to earlier regulations which encouraged public sector organisations to make information available for re-use.&nbsp; The 2015 regulations go further, and make it mandatory to make information available for re-use.</p>

            <h3>Public sector information</h3>

            <p>Public sector information is any information created by a public sector organisation in undertaking their public task.&nbsp;We have&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="index">statement of public task</a> ,&nbsp;that describes this for potential re-users.</p>

            <h3>Re-use</h3>

            <p>Re-use means use for any purpose other than that for which the information was originally produced.</p>

            <h3>Find out more</h3>

            <p>The National Archives has published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/regulations/">Guidance and Best Practice Advice</a>&nbsp;on the regulations for public sector organisations and potential re-users.</p>

            <h3>Information&nbsp;the Scottish Government has&nbsp;available for re-use</h3>

            <p>As information assets become available for re-use they will be added to the Re-use Register.</p>

            <p>In addition, section 23 of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 requires that all Scottish public authorities maintain a publication scheme setting out the types of information that are routinely made available.&nbsp;For more details on our&nbsp;publication scheme, see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/guide-to-information/">Guide to Information</a>. Information published under our publication scheme can be made available for re-use.</p>

            <h3>Information for Re-use Register</h3>

            <p>Assets&nbsp;are added to this register as they become available for re-use.</p>

            <h2>The Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations</h2>

            <p>These regulations came into force from 18 July 2015 and establish the UK framework for the re-use of public sector information.&nbsp;The purpose is to make information easier to re-use, resulting in economic, social and civil benefits.&nbsp;They are an update to earlier regulations which encouraged public sector organisations to make information available for re-use.&nbsp; The 2015 regulations go further, and make it mandatory to make information available for re-use.</p>

            <h3>Public sector information</h3>

            <h3>Re-use</h3>

            <p>If something goes wrong or you are dissatisfied with our service, please tell us. We will work with you to resolve it.</p>

            <h2>What you can complain about</h2>

            <p>You can complain about things like:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>delays in responding to your enquiries and requests</li>
             <li>failure to provide a service</li>
             <li>our standard of service</li>
             <li>our policy</li>
             <li>treatment by, or attitude of, a member of staff</li>
             <li>our failure to follow proper procedure</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your complaint may involve more than one service or be about someone working on our behalf.</p>

            <p>There are some things we can't deal with through our complaints handling procedure.</p>

            <p>These include:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>a routine first-time request for a service, for example, local services, transport, housing, health provision</li>
             <li>requests for compensation from external organisations</li>
             <li>things that are covered by a right of appeal, for example, planning and related appeal decisions</li>
             <li>Freedom of Information or Environmental Information request decisions</li>
             <li>legal proceedings or judgements</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If other procedures or rights of appeal can help you resolve your concerns, we will give information and advice to help you.</p>

            <h2>Get help to make a complaint</h2>

            <p>Anyone can make a complaint to us, including the representatives of someone who is dissatisfied with our service.</p>

            <p>There may be reasons why you are unable, or reluctant, to make a complaint yourself. We can take complaints from a friend, relative, or an advocate, if you have given them your consent to complain for you.</p>

            <p>You can find out about advocates in your area by contacting the <a href="http://www.siaa.org.uk">Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance</a>.</p>

            <h2>Timescales to complain</h2>

            <p>Normally, you must make your complaint within six months of the event.</p>

            <p>However, if you do not find out that you have a reason to complain until later, you can lodge a complaint up to 12 months after the event itself.</p>

            <p>In exceptional circumstances we may be able to accept a complaint after the time limit. If you feel that the time limit should not apply to your complaint, please tell us why.</p>

            <h2>What happens when you complain</h2>

            <p>We will always tell you who is dealing with your complaint.</p>

            <p>Our complaints handling procedure has three stages.</p>

            <h3>1. How to complain: frontline resolution</h3>

            <p>Contact staff in the area responsible for the service which has caused you concern.</p>

            <p>You can find the right person to talk to by:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>checking our list of <a href="contact-information">contact points</a></li>
             <li>emailing <a href="mailto:sgcomplaints@gov.scot">sgcomplaints@gov.scot</a></li>
             <li>writing to Scottish Government, Complaints, 1E.10, St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, EH1 3DG</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We aim to resolve your complaint informally within five working days.</p>

            <p>If we can't resolve the issue, you can take your complaint to stage two of the complaints procedure.</p>

            <h3>2. If you are not satisfied: investigation</h3>

            <p>An Investigating Officer will be appointed to prepare a comprehensive report and, if we have got things wrong, will recommend improvements.</p>

            <p>We will:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>acknowledge receipt of your complaint within three working days</li>
             <li>where appropriate, discuss the complaint with you to understand why you remain dissatisfied and what outcome you are looking for</li>
             <li>give you a full response as soon as possible and within 20 working days</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will tell you if our investigation will take longer and will agree revised time limits with you.</p>

            <p>After we have fully investigated and you remain dissatisfied, you then have the option of asking the Scottish Public Service Ombudsman (SPSO) to investigate your complaint.</p>

            <h3>3. Independent investigation of your complaint: ombudsman</h3>

            <p>The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) is the final stage for complaints about public services in Scotland and may be able to independently take up a complaint on your behalf.</p>

            <p>The Ombudsman will normally only be able to act if you have followed the steps above.</p>

            <p>To find out about the Ombudsman's work, visit the <a href="http://www.spso.org.uk/">Scottish Public Services Ombudsman</a> website, or write to the office at: Freepost SPSO (this is all you need write on the envelope, and you do not need to use a stamp).</p>

            <h3>Gàidhlig</h3>

            <h1>Cuiribh gearan thugainn</h1>

            <p>Ma thèid rudeigin ceàrr no mura bheil sibh riaraichte leis an t-seirbheis againn, cuiribh fios thugainn. Obraichidh sinn còmhla ribh gus fuasgladh fhaighinn.</p>

            <h2>Dè an seorsa gearan a dh'fhaodar a chuir thugainn</h2>

            <p>Faodar gearan a chuir thugainn mu na cuspairean a leanas:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>dàil ann am freagairtean ri na ceistean agus iarrtasan agaibh</li>
             <li>nach deach seirbheis air choireigin a lìbhrigeadh ceart</li>
             <li>ìre na seirbheis againn</li>
             <li>na poileasaidhean againn</li>
             <li>mar a chaidh ur làimhseachadh le luchd-obrach</li>
             <li>nach deach dòighean-obrach ceart a leantail</li>
            </ul>

            <p>'S dòcha gum bi gearan agaibh mu dheidhinn barrachd is aon seirbheis, neo mu dheidhinn cuideigin eile a tha ag obair às ar leth.</p>

            <p>Tha cùisean ann ris nach urrainn dhuinn dèiligeadh tron phròiseas gearain</p>

            <p>Nam measg tha na cùisean a leanas:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>iarrtas sìmplidh airson seirbheis airson a' chiad uair, mar eisimpleir seirbheisean ionadail, còmhdhail, taigheadas, solar slàinte</li>
             <li>iarrtasan airson dìoladh bho bhuidhnean air leth bhon riaghaltas</li>
             <li>cùisean far a bheil còir ath-thagraidh ann, mar eisimpleir, planadh agus dearbhaidhean ath-thagraidh co-cheangailte ris</li>
             <li>dearbhaidhean a thaobh Saorsa an Fhiosrachaidh no Fiosrachadh Àrainneachdail</li>
             <li>cùisean no breithean lagha</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ma tha modhan-obrach no còirichean ath-thagraidh a dh'fhaodadh ur cuideachadh gus fuasgladh fhaighinn, bheir sinn seachad fiosrachadh agus comhairle gus ur cuideachadh.</p>

            <h2>Faigh cuideachadh gus gearan a chuir thugainn</h2>

            <p>Faodaidh duine sam bith gearan a chuir thugainn, a' gabhail a-steach riochdairean airson cuideigein nach eil riaraichte leis an t-seirbheis againn.</p>

            <p>'S dòcha gum bi adhbharan ann nach urrainn dhut fhèin, no nach eil sibh fhèin airson, gearan a chuir thugainn. Faodaidh sinn gearanan a chluinntinn bho charaidean, bho chàirdean, no bho neach-tagraidh eile, ma tha sibh air cead a thoirt dhaibh gearan a chuir thugainn às ur leth.</p>

            <p>Gheibh sibh fiosrachadh mu dheidhinn luchd-tagraidh san sgìre agaibh fhèin bho <a href="http://www.siaa.org.uk">Chaidreachas Tagraidh Neo-eisimileach na h-Alba</a>.</p>

            <h2>Raon-ama airson gearan a chuir thugainn</h2>

            <p>Mar as trice, feumaidh sibh gearan a chuir thugainn taobh a-steach sia mìosan às deidh dhan tachartas. Mura bheil fios agaibh gu bheil adhbhar gearain agaibh aig an àm, ge-tà, faodaidh sibh gearan a chuir thugainn suas ri 12 mìosan às deidh dhan tachartas fhèin.</p>

            <p>Ma tha suidheachadh air leth ann 's dòcha gun urrainn dhuinn gearan a chluinntinn às deidh don cheann-là a dhol seachad. Mura bheil sibh a' smaointinn gum bu chòir dhuinn ur gearan a chluinntinn às deidh dhan cheann-là, innsibh dhuinn carson.</p>

            <h2>Dè thachras nuair a chuireas sibh gearan thugainn</h2>

            <p>Innsidh sinn dhuibh cò a tha a' dèiligeadh ris an gearan agaibh.</p>

            <p>Tha an dòigh a dhèiligeas sinn ris ann an trì ìrean.</p>

            <h3>1. Mar a chuireas sibh gearan thugainn: fuasgladh aig an toiseach</h3>

            <p>Cuiribh fios gu luchd-obrach san raon aig a bheil dleastanas airson na seirbheis a tha a' cur dragh oirbh.</p>

            <p>Faodaidh sibh an neach iomchaidh a lorg anns na dòighean a leanas:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>coimheadaibh air an liosta de <a href="contact-information">dhòighean conaltraidh</a></li>
             <li>cuiribh post-d gu <a href="mailto:sgcomplaints@gov.scot">sgcomplaints@gov.scot</a></li>
             <li>sgrìobhaibh gu Riaghaltas na h-Alba, 1E.10, Taigh Naomh Anndrais, Dùn Èideann, EH1 3DG</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Tha sinn ag amas gus fuasgladh fhaighinn dhuibh taobh a-steach còig làithean-obrach.</p>

            <p>Mura faigh sinn fuasgladh dhuibh, faodaidh sibh ur gearan a thoirt gu ìre a dhà den phròiseas gearain.</p>

            <h3>2. Mura bheil sibh riaraichte: rannsachadh</h3>

            <p>Thèid Oifigear Rannsachaidh ainmeachadh airson aithisg ioma-chuimseach a dheasachadh agus, ma tha sinn air rud sam bith a dhèanamh cearr, molaidh iad dòighean a dhèanamh nas fheàrr.</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Cuiridh sinn fios thugaibh gun d' fhuair sinn ur gearan taobh a-steach trì làithean-obrach</li>
             <li>Bruidhnidh sinn ribh airson gun tuig sinn carson a tha sibh fhathast mi-riaraichte agus dè tha sibh an dùil gun dèan sinn</li>
             <li>Cuiridh sinn freagairt slàn thugaibh cho luath 's a ghabhas, taobh a-steach 20 latha-obrach</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Cuiridh sinn fios thugaibh ma mhaireas ar rannsachadh nas fhaide na seo agus aontaichaidh sinn raon-ama ùr còmhla ribh.</p>

            <p>Ma tha sinn air rannsachadh slàn a dhèanamh agus tha sibh fhathast miriaraichte, faodaidh sibh iarraidh air Ombudsman Seirbheisean Poblach na h-Alba (SPSO) ar gearan a rannsachadh.</p>

            <h3>3. Rannsachadh neo-eisimileach air ur gearan: ombudsman</h3>

            <p>'S e Ombudsman Seirbheisean Poblach na h-Alba (SPSO) an ìre mu dheireadh airson gearanan mu dheidhinn seirbheisean poblach ann an Alba agus 's dòcha gun urrainn dhaibh gearan a thogail às ur leth.</p>

            <p>Sa chumantas, chan urrainn don Ombudsman seo a thogail mura bheil sibh air na ceumannan gu h-àrd a leantail.</p>

            <p>Faodar tuilleadh fiosrachaidh mu dheidhinn obair na h-Ombudsman fhaicinn aig <a href="http://www.spso.org.uk/">Ombudsman Seirbheisean Poblach na h-Alba</a>, neo sgrìobhaibh thuca aig: Freepost SPSO (chan fheum sibh ach seo a sgrìobhadh air a' chèis, agus chan eil feum stampa a chuir air).</p>

            <p>If other procedures or rights of appeal can help you resolve your concerns, we will give information and advice to help you.</p>

            <h2>Get help to make a complaint</h2>

            <p>Anyone can make a complaint to us, including the representatives of someone who is dissatisfied with our service.</p>

            <p>There may be reasons why you are unable, or reluctant, to make a complaint yourself. We can take complaints from a friend, relative, or an advocate, if you have given them your consent to complain for you.</p>

            <p>You can find out about advocates in your area by contacting the <a href="http://www.siaa.org.uk">Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance</a>.</p>

            <h2>Timescales to complain</h2>

            <p>Normally, you must make your complaint within six months of the event.</p>

            <p>However, if you do not find out that you have a reason to complain until later, you can lodge a complaint up to 12 months after the event itself.</p>

            <p>In exceptional circumstances we may be able to accept a complaint after the time limit. If you feel that the time limit should not apply to your complaint, please tell us why.</p>

            <h2>What happens when you complain</h2>

            <p>We will always tell you who is dealing with your complaint.</p>

            <p>Our complaints handling procedure has three stages.</p>

            <h3>1. How to complain: frontline resolution</h3>

            <p>Contact staff in the area responsible for the service which has caused you concern.</p>

            <p>You can find the right person to talk to by:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>checking our list of <a href="contact-information">contact points</a></li>
             <li>emailing <a href="mailto:sgcomplaints@gov.scot">sgcomplaints@gov.scot</a></li>
             <li>writing to Scottish Government, Complaints, 1E.10, St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, EH1 3DG</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We aim to resolve your complaint informally within five working days.</p>

            <p>If we can't resolve the issue, you can take your complaint to stage two of the complaints procedure.</p>

            <h3>2. If you are not satisfied: investigation</h3>

            <p>An Investigating Officer will be appointed to prepare a comprehensive report and, if we have got things wrong, will recommend improvements.</p>

            <p>We will:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>acknowledge receipt of your complaint within three working days</li>
             <li>where appropriate, discuss the complaint with you to understand why you remain dissatisfied and what outcome you are looking for</li>
             <li>give you a full response as soon as possible and within 20 working days</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will tell you if our investigation will take longer and will agree revised time limits with you.</p>

            <p>After we have fully investigated and you remain dissatisfied, you then have the option of asking the Scottish Public Service Ombudsman (SPSO) to investigate your complaint.</p>

            <h3>3. Independent investigation of your complaint: ombudsman</h3>

            <p>The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) is the final stage for complaints about public services in Scotland and may be able to independently take up a complaint on your behalf.</p>

            <p>The Ombudsman will normally only be able to act if you have followed the steps above.</p>

            <p>To find out about the Ombudsman's work, visit the <a href="http://www.spso.org.uk/">Scottish Public Services Ombudsman</a> website, or write to the office at: Freepost SPSO (this is all you need write on the envelope, and you do not need to use a stamp).</p>

            <h2>Dè an seorsa gearan a dh'fhaodar a chuir thugainn</h2>

            <p>Faodar gearan a chuir thugainn mu na cuspairean a leanas:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>dàil ann am freagairtean ri na ceistean agus iarrtasan agaibh</li>
             <li>nach deach seirbheis air choireigin a lìbhrigeadh ceart</li>

             <li>nach deach dòighean-obrach ceart a leantail</li>
            </ul>

            <p>'S dòcha gum bi gearan agaibh mu dheidhinn barrachd is aon seirbheis, neo mu dheidhinn cuideigin eile a tha ag obair às ar leth.</p>

            <p>Tha cùisean ann ris nach urrainn dhuinn dèiligeadh tron phròiseas gearain</p>

            <p>Nam measg tha na cùisean a leanas:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>iarrtas sìmplidh airson seirbheis airson a' chiad uair, mar eisimpleir seirbheisean ionadail, còmhdhail, taigheadas, solar slàinte</li>
             <li>iarrtasan airson dìoladh bho bhuidhnean air leth bhon riaghaltas</li>
             <li>cùisean far a bheil còir ath-thagraidh ann, mar eisimpleir, planadh agus dearbhaidhean ath-thagraidh co-cheangailte ris</li>
             <li>dearbhaidhean a thaobh Saorsa an Fhiosrachaidh no Fiosrachadh Àrainneachdail</li>
             <li>cùisean no breithean lagha</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ma tha modhan-obrach no còirichean ath-thagraidh a dh'fhaodadh ur cuideachadh gus fuasgladh fhaighinn, bheir sinn seachad fiosrachadh agus comhairle gus ur cuideachadh.</p>

            <h2>Faigh cuideachadh gus gearan a chuir thugainn</h2>

            <p>Faodaidh duine sam bith gearan a chuir thugainn, a' gabhail a-steach riochdairean airson cuideigein nach eil riaraichte leis an t-seirbheis againn.</p>

            <p>'S dòcha gum bi adhbharan ann nach urrainn dhut fhèin, no nach eil sibh fhèin airson, gearan a chuir thugainn. Faodaidh sinn gearanan a chluinntinn bho charaidean, bho chàirdean, no bho neach-tagraidh eile, ma tha sibh air cead a thoirt dhaibh gearan a chuir thugainn às ur leth.</p>

            <p>Gheibh sibh fiosrachadh mu dheidhinn luchd-tagraidh san sgìre agaibh fhèin bho <a href="http://www.siaa.org.uk">Chaidreachas Tagraidh Neo-eisimileach na h-Alba</a>.</p>

            <h2>Raon-ama airson gearan a chuir thugainn</h2>

            <p>Mar as trice, feumaidh sibh gearan a chuir thugainn taobh a-steach sia mìosan às deidh dhan tachartas. Mura bheil fios agaibh gu bheil adhbhar gearain agaibh aig an àm, ge-tà, faodaidh sibh gearan a chuir thugainn suas ri 12 mìosan às deidh dhan tachartas fhèin.</p>

            <p>Ma tha suidheachadh air leth ann 's dòcha gun urrainn dhuinn gearan a chluinntinn às deidh don cheann-là a dhol seachad. Mura bheil sibh a' smaointinn gum bu chòir dhuinn ur gearan a chluinntinn às deidh dhan cheann-là, innsibh dhuinn carson.</p>

            <h2>Dè thachras nuair a chuireas sibh gearan thugainn</h2>

            <p>Innsidh sinn dhuibh cò a tha a' dèiligeadh ris an gearan agaibh.</p>

            <p>Tha an dòigh a dhèiligeas sinn ris ann an trì ìrean.</p>

            <p>Cuiribh fios gu luchd-obrach san raon aig a bheil dleastanas airson na seirbheis a tha a' cur dragh oirbh.</p>

            <p>Faodaidh sibh an neach iomchaidh a lorg anns na dòighean a leanas:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>coimheadaibh air an liosta de <a href="contact-information">dhòighean conaltraidh</a></li>

             <li>sgrìobhaibh gu Riaghaltas na h-Alba, 1E.10, Taigh Naomh Anndrais, Dùn Èideann, EH1 3DG</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Tha sinn ag amas gus fuasgladh fhaighinn dhuibh taobh a-steach còig làithean-obrach.</p>

            <p>Mura faigh sinn fuasgladh dhuibh, faodaidh sibh ur gearan a thoirt gu ìre a dhà den phròiseas gearain.</p>

            <h3>2. Mura bheil sibh riaraichte: rannsachadh</h3>

            <p>Thèid Oifigear Rannsachaidh ainmeachadh airson aithisg ioma-chuimseach a dheasachadh agus, ma tha sinn air rud sam bith a dhèanamh cearr, molaidh iad dòighean a dhèanamh nas fheàrr.</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Cuiridh sinn fios thugaibh gun d' fhuair sinn ur gearan taobh a-steach trì làithean-obrach</li>
             <li>Bruidhnidh sinn ribh airson gun tuig sinn carson a tha sibh fhathast mi-riaraichte agus dè tha sibh an dùil gun dèan sinn</li>
             <li>Cuiridh sinn freagairt slàn thugaibh cho luath 's a ghabhas, taobh a-steach 20 latha-obrach</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Cuiridh sinn fios thugaibh ma mhaireas ar rannsachadh nas fhaide na seo agus aontaichaidh sinn raon-ama ùr còmhla ribh.</p>

            <p>Ma tha sinn air rannsachadh slàn a dhèanamh agus tha sibh fhathast miriaraichte, faodaidh sibh iarraidh air Ombudsman Seirbheisean Poblach na h-Alba (SPSO) ar gearan a rannsachadh.</p>

            <h3>3. Rannsachadh neo-eisimileach air ur gearan: ombudsman</h3>

            <p>'S e Ombudsman Seirbheisean Poblach na h-Alba (SPSO) an ìre mu dheireadh airson gearanan mu dheidhinn seirbheisean poblach ann an Alba agus 's dòcha gun urrainn dhaibh gearan a thogail às ur leth.</p>

            <p>Sa chumantas, chan urrainn don Ombudsman seo a thogail mura bheil sibh air na ceumannan gu h-àrd a leantail.</p>

            <p>Faodar tuilleadh fiosrachaidh mu dheidhinn obair na h-Ombudsman fhaicinn aig <a href="http://www.spso.org.uk/">Ombudsman Seirbheisean Poblach na h-Alba</a>, neo sgrìobhaibh thuca aig: Freepost SPSO (chan fheum sibh ach seo a sgrìobhadh air a' chèis, agus chan eil feum stampa a chuir air).</p>
