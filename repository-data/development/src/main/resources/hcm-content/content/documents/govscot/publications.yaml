                  <p>We use consultation as one way of gathering the views of both the public and professional experts. This short note outlines our approach to consultations. It provides an overview of what consultations are, the principles a good consultation is based on and what processes are involved. The note is aimed at anybody who is interested in the consultation process.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="consultations and what they can be used for" id="consultations and what they can be used for"></a>Consultations and what they can be used for</h3>

                  <p>A consultation is an opportunity for members of the public to comment on plans or ideas which are being considered, and share experiences, knowledge or ideas that help inform decision-makers.</p>

                  <p>When done well, a consultation provides valuable evidence of the range of experiences and opinions, knowledge and ideas regarding a given issue. This can help policymakers improve their decision making.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo0_O-LUIR0&amp;feature=youtu.be">short video summary</a>.</p>

                  <p>Consultations are open for all citizens to reply to. They can vary in size and type, depending on their aims. “General” consultations often attract responses from a wide audience with a general interest in the topic, and can receive a high number of responses. Other consultations are very specific and are only of interest to a small number of professional stakeholders.&nbsp;These are sometimes referred to as “technical” consultations. Only a limited number of people respond to these, often stakeholders, professionals and policy officials with a high level of understanding of the issue.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>For all consultations, those people who respond actively choose to participate because they have an interest in the consultation topic. Accordingly, a consultation process cannot be used to indicate levels of public support for a proposal or represent the views of the wider public.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>Why we consult</h4>

                  <p>Engaging with people and stakeholder organisations is a key part of the Scottish approach to policymaking. Consultation is an essential and important aspect of our public engagement.</p>

                  <p>Consultations can be used to:</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>inform the development of a particular policy</li>
                   <li>help decisions to be made between alternative policy proposals</li>
                   <li>finalise new legislation before it is implemented</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Consultation enables us to ask a lot of different people about their views. This should &nbsp;improve the policy or law being developed and make sure that it works in the real world. It can expand the pool of expertise contributing to the policymaking process and provides a richer evidence base. It also promotes transparency and legitimacy in the process.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>How we consult</h4>

                  <p>A good consultation should be accessible for people. The consultation should clearly explain what it is seeking people’s views on and make sure that people are able to respond.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>There are many ways in which we consult Scottish citizens and organisations. Consultation can be done using written papers, public meetings, focus groups, questionnaires or online discussion forums. Traditionally, one of the most common ways of consulting is through a written consultation paper. However, this is only one of many ways that policymakers can ask, listen to, and act on, the views of citizens and stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The UK Government sets out 11 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consultation-principles-guidance">principles of good consultation</a>. There are also <a href="https://law.gov.wales/constitution-government/public-admin/intro-admin-law/welsh-government-guidance-on-making-good-decisions/has-any-consultation-been-carried-out-fairly-and-properly/what-are-the-requirements-for-any-consultation-that-is-carried-out/?lang=en">minimum legal standards</a> called The Gunning Principles that a fair and worthwhile exercise must follow. We are committed to being open and transparent via the <a href="https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/">National Performance Framework</a> and the <a href="index">Open Government Action Plan</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Our consultations are mainly done online using our <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/">consultation hub</a>. The consultation hub is a user friendly tool, designed to improve the accessibility and transparency of our consultations. A full listing of open and closed consultations are available on the hub. In addition to that, consultations might be promoted on our social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter and via our <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/about/">mailing list</a>. Sometimes stakeholder groups with an interest in a consultation will let their members know about a consultation and we are often able to accept non-digital responses.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Typically, written consultations present a report laying out the issues under consideration and ask specific questions or for more general views about the topic. Written consultations should provide adequate time for response. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Following the closing date, all responses are analysed and an analysis report is published on <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/">our website</a> and the consultation hub.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>What we consult on</h4>

                  <p>We consult on a wide range of policies, draft bills and regulations. These can include broad policy areas such <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/energy-and-climate-change-directorate/fracking-unconventional-oil-and-gas/">fracking</a>, and <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/animal-welfare/animal-health-welfare-act-amendment-2019/">animal health and welfare</a> as well as more specific issues such as <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/managing-flood-risk/reservoirs-amendment/">amendments to regulations on reservoirs</a> and the <a href="index_1">Land and Buildings Transaction Tax Group Relief</a>. On average, we publish 100 consultations per year.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>When we consult</h4>

                  <p>Consultations can occur at different stages in the policy process, from the development of initial policy ideas through to the finalisation of legislation. There is no set time to hold a consultation – the important thing is that the consultation takes place at an appropriate time, so that responses received can meaningfully inform the decision being made. Consultation will always happen before a final policy decision has been taken.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>Who we consult</h4>

                  <p>A written consultation is open to all people and organisations who wish to express their opinions on a proposed area of work. In other words, anyone who is interested in contributing their views, is encouraged to do so.&nbsp;We use other methods to ensure that people who have an interest in the policy area but do not have the means or opportunity to send a written response, have an opportunity to give views.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>How to respond to a consultation</h4>

                  <p>If you want to respond to a consultation, the most common way to do so is online through our&nbsp;consultation hub. However, it is usually possible to respond in other ways too, such as by email or letter. If consultation events are being held, you might prefer to attend an event rather than provide a written response. Closing dates are clearly advertised on the consultation paper and on the consultation hub website.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Sometimes consultations are available in alternative formats, such as “easy read”, British Sign Language or languages other than English.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The consultation will provide a brief overview of the policy issue being consulted on. It will then ask specific questions or ask for your views on the proposal. Sometimes they include a glossary to make sure people understand the terms being used.</p>

                  <p>If you are completing the consultation on our consultation hub you are able to save and come back to your response. You do not need to complete it all in one go. &nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="What we do with consultation responses" id="What we do with consultation responses"></a>What we do with consultation responses</h3>

                  <h4>Analysis of consultation responses&nbsp;</h4>

                  <p>Once the consultation has closed and responses have been submitted, we need to make sense of the responses so these can inform the policy.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Analysis of responses is necessary to capture and summarise the results. This can be done either internally (within the Scottish Government) or using an external research contractor. Consultation responses will be analysed fairly, rigorously and systematically, regardless of whether they are analysed internally or externally. Consultation analysis findings are normally presented in a written report which is published on our website. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The analysis, and analysis report, reflects the range and breadth of views expressed during the consultation. It&nbsp;identifies key themes emerging from the responses and the arguments behind these. It also describes how many responses were received and provides details on the respondents’ profile if available. &nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>All valid responses are analysed&nbsp;</h4>

                  <p>A response to a consultation is usually considered valid if it is relevant to the subject matter of the consultation.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>Moderation policy&nbsp;</h4>

                  <p>We moderate all responses to ensure that they are appropriate and not offensive or harmful to others. We will analyse all responses, but we will not publish responses which contain material which:</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>raises concerns about data protection or copyright</li>
                   <li>is potentially defamatory</li>
                   <li>has offensive material&nbsp;</li>
                   <li>contains references to on-going court cases</li>
                   <li>impersonates or falsely claims to represent another person or organisation</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Publishing responses</h4>

                  <p>Everyone who responds to a written consultation (the “respondent”) will be asked to fill out a Respondent Information Form (RIF). If responding online, this is on the “About You” page. This asks respondents if they give us permission to publish their response. Respondents can choose to:&nbsp;</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>publish response with name</li>
                   <li>publish response only (without name)</li>
                   <li>do not publish response</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>We will only ever publish a response where we have been given permission to do so. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>These responses will usually be made available to the public at <a href="http://consult.gov.scot">http://consult.gov.scot</a>, alongside the analysis report.</p>

                  <p>The names of organisations responding to consultations will be published.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>How we handle personal data</h4>

                  <p>We collect names and email addresses with every response we receive through our <a href="http://consult.gov.scot">consultation platform</a>.</p>

                  <p>Email addresses are used to send an acknowledgement of response following submission. They may also be used to contact you in the future in relation to the consultation exercise if you give consent to be contacted.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Where permission is given, we publish responses. We include <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/">personal data</a> where permission has been given to do so. We never publish email or postal addresses and will delete personal data when the consultation is finished.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>For information on how we collect&nbsp;and process&nbsp;your data please see our main <a href="https://www.gov.scot/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="How we report consultation findings" id="How we report consultation findings"></a>How we report consultation findings</h3>

                  <p>A good consultation should be transparent in showing what people have said and how these views have been considered by decision-makers. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>One of the main ways we do this is on the “<a href="https://consult.gov.scot/we_asked_you_said/">We Asked, You Said, We Did” section</a> of our consultation website. This briefly summaries the main points of the consultation (We Asked”), how many responses there were and key messages coming out of the responses (“You Said”) and what we have done, or plan to do as a result of the consultation (“We did”).&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>More detail on the responses received will be found in the full consultation analysis report which will be published and available on our website. Most recently published consultation reports are highlighted in our <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/about/">mailing list</a>. In addition, where permission was given to publish them, individual consultation responses are normally made available on our consultation hub.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>We aim to report back within the same length of time as people were given to respond to the consultation,.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The way consultation responses shape decisions and are reported varies depending on the type of the consultation. A single consultation may need a number of different outputs to meet the needs of the policy process, the needs of the audience and to provide effective feedback to respondents.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Once the consultation responses have been analysed, we will publish a statement of what has been done or is going to be done and why and how the consultation has informed these decisions. This publication could be, for example, the final version of a new strategy, the announcement of a new policy position, or plans for new legislation. The output from the analysis of your consultation responses will be used by the Scottish Parliament, its committees and other external groups to scrutinise the consultation exercise.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="Benefits and limitations of a consultation&nbsp;" id="Benefits and limitations of a consultation&nbsp;"></a>Benefits and limitations of a consultation&nbsp;</h3>

                  <p>A consultation can tell us about the broad range of views that exist on a particular policy issue. It can also give us lots of detail about why respondents hold those views. Consultations allow respondents to comment on proposed options – telling us what aspects are of the most importance to them, and letting us know if they have any concerns, or what the benefits might be. Respondents can also suggest alternative options. The information collected during a consultation is valuable in shaping policy decisions but needs to also be considered alongside other sources of evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>It can be tempting to think that if a lot of people give their views in a consultation, then this will be representative of the wider population. This is not the case. Respondents to a consultation have actively chosen to participate because they have an interest in the topic. In contrast a representative survey will capture the views of wider spread of citizens with different levels of interest in the topic.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>We use consultation as one way of gathering the views of both the public and professional experts. This short note outlines our approach to consultations. It provides an overview of what consultations are, the principles a good consultation is based on and what processes are involved. The note is aimed at anybody who is interested in the consultation process.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="consultations and what they can be used for" id="consultations and what they can be used for"></a>Consultations and what they can be used for</h3>

                  <p>A consultation is an opportunity for members of the public to comment on plans or ideas which are being considered, and share experiences, knowledge or ideas that help inform decision-makers.</p>

                  <p>When done well, a consultation provides valuable evidence of the range of experiences and opinions, knowledge and ideas regarding a given issue. This can help policymakers improve their decision making.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo0_O-LUIR0&amp;feature=youtu.be">short video summary</a>.</p>

                  <p>Consultations are open for all citizens to reply to. They can vary in size and type, depending on their aims. “General” consultations often attract responses from a wide audience with a general interest in the topic, and can receive a high number of responses. Other consultations are very specific and are only of interest to a small number of professional stakeholders.&nbsp;These are sometimes referred to as “technical” consultations. Only a limited number of people respond to these, often stakeholders, professionals and policy officials with a high level of understanding of the issue.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>For all consultations, those people who respond actively choose to participate because they have an interest in the consultation topic. Accordingly, a consultation process cannot be used to indicate levels of public support for a proposal or represent the views of the wider public.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>Why we consult</h4>

                  <p>Engaging with people and stakeholder organisations is a key part of the Scottish approach to policymaking. Consultation is an essential and important aspect of our public engagement.</p>

                  <p>Consultations can be used to:</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>inform the development of a particular policy</li>
                   <li>help decisions to be made between alternative policy proposals</li>
                   <li>finalise new legislation before it is implemented</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Consultation enables us to ask a lot of different people about their views. This should &nbsp;improve the policy or law being developed and make sure that it works in the real world. It can expand the pool of expertise contributing to the policymaking process and provides a richer evidence base. It also promotes transparency and legitimacy in the process.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>How we consult</h4>

                  <p>A good consultation should be accessible for people. The consultation should clearly explain what it is seeking people’s views on and make sure that people are able to respond.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>There are many ways in which we consult Scottish citizens and organisations. Consultation can be done using written papers, public meetings, focus groups, questionnaires or online discussion forums. Traditionally, one of the most common ways of consulting is through a written consultation paper. However, this is only one of many ways that policymakers can ask, listen to, and act on, the views of citizens and stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The UK Government sets out 11 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consultation-principles-guidance">principles of good consultation</a>. There are also <a href="https://law.gov.wales/constitution-government/public-admin/intro-admin-law/welsh-government-guidance-on-making-good-decisions/has-any-consultation-been-carried-out-fairly-and-properly/what-are-the-requirements-for-any-consultation-that-is-carried-out/?lang=en">minimum legal standards</a> called The Gunning Principles that a fair and worthwhile exercise must follow. We are committed to being open and transparent via the <a href="https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/">National Performance Framework</a> and the <a href="index">Open Government Action Plan</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Our consultations are mainly done online using our <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/">consultation hub</a>. The consultation hub is a user friendly tool, designed to improve the accessibility and transparency of our consultations. A full listing of open and closed consultations are available on the hub. In addition to that, consultations might be promoted on our social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter and via our <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/about/">mailing list</a>. Sometimes stakeholder groups with an interest in a consultation will let their members know about a consultation and we are often able to accept non-digital responses.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Typically, written consultations present a report laying out the issues under consideration and ask specific questions or for more general views about the topic. Written consultations should provide adequate time for response. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Following the closing date, all responses are analysed and an analysis report is published on <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/">our website</a> and the consultation hub.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>What we consult on</h4>

                  <p>We consult on a wide range of policies, draft bills and regulations. These can include broad policy areas such <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/energy-and-climate-change-directorate/fracking-unconventional-oil-and-gas/">fracking</a>, and <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/animal-welfare/animal-health-welfare-act-amendment-2019/">animal health and welfare</a> as well as more specific issues such as <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/managing-flood-risk/reservoirs-amendment/">amendments to regulations on reservoirs</a> and the <a href="index_1">Land and Buildings Transaction Tax Group Relief</a>. On average, we publish 100 consultations per year.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>When we consult</h4>

                  <p>Consultations can occur at different stages in the policy process, from the development of initial policy ideas through to the finalisation of legislation. There is no set time to hold a consultation – the important thing is that the consultation takes place at an appropriate time, so that responses received can meaningfully inform the decision being made. Consultation will always happen before a final policy decision has been taken.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>Who we consult</h4>

                  <p>A written consultation is open to all people and organisations who wish to express their opinions on a proposed area of work. In other words, anyone who is interested in contributing their views, is encouraged to do so.&nbsp;We use other methods to ensure that people who have an interest in the policy area but do not have the means or opportunity to send a written response, have an opportunity to give views.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>How to respond to a consultation</h4>

                  <p>If you want to respond to a consultation, the most common way to do so is online through our&nbsp;consultation hub. However, it is usually possible to respond in other ways too, such as by email or letter. If consultation events are being held, you might prefer to attend an event rather than provide a written response. Closing dates are clearly advertised on the consultation paper and on the consultation hub website.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Sometimes consultations are available in alternative formats, such as “easy read”, British Sign Language or languages other than English.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The consultation will provide a brief overview of the policy issue being consulted on. It will then ask specific questions or ask for your views on the proposal. Sometimes they include a glossary to make sure people understand the terms being used.</p>

                  <p>If you are completing the consultation on our consultation hub you are able to save and come back to your response. You do not need to complete it all in one go. &nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="What we do with consultation responses" id="What we do with consultation responses"></a>What we do with consultation responses</h3>

                  <h4>Analysis of consultation responses&nbsp;</h4>

                  <p>Once the consultation has closed and responses have been submitted, we need to make sense of the responses so these can inform the policy.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Analysis of responses is necessary to capture and summarise the results. This can be done either internally (within the Scottish Government) or using an external research contractor. Consultation responses will be analysed fairly, rigorously and systematically, regardless of whether they are analysed internally or externally. Consultation analysis findings are normally presented in a written report which is published on our website. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The analysis, and analysis report, reflects the range and breadth of views expressed during the consultation. It&nbsp;identifies key themes emerging from the responses and the arguments behind these. It also describes how many responses were received and provides details on the respondents’ profile if available. &nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>All valid responses are analysed&nbsp;</h4>

                  <p>A response to a consultation is usually considered valid if it is relevant to the subject matter of the consultation.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>Moderation policy&nbsp;</h4>

                  <p>We moderate all responses to ensure that they are appropriate and not offensive or harmful to others. We will analyse all responses, but we will not publish responses which contain material which:</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>raises concerns about data protection or copyright</li>
                   <li>is potentially defamatory</li>
                   <li>has offensive material&nbsp;</li>
                   <li>contains references to on-going court cases</li>
                   <li>impersonates or falsely claims to represent another person or organisation</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Publishing responses</h4>

                  <p>Everyone who responds to a written consultation (the “respondent”) will be asked to fill out a Respondent Information Form (RIF). If responding online, this is on the “About You” page. This asks respondents if they give us permission to publish their response. Respondents can choose to:&nbsp;</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>publish response with name</li>
                   <li>publish response only (without name)</li>
                   <li>do not publish response</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>We will only ever publish a response where we have been given permission to do so. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>These responses will usually be made available to the public at <a href="http://consult.gov.scot">http://consult.gov.scot</a>, alongside the analysis report.</p>

                  <p>The names of organisations responding to consultations will be published.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>How we handle personal data</h4>

                  <p>We collect names and email addresses with every response we receive through our <a href="http://consult.gov.scot">consultation platform</a>.</p>

                  <p>Email addresses are used to send an acknowledgement of response following submission. They may also be used to contact you in the future in relation to the consultation exercise if you give consent to be contacted.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Where permission is given, we publish responses. We include <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/">personal data</a> where permission has been given to do so. We never publish email or postal addresses and will delete personal data when the consultation is finished.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>For information on how we collect&nbsp;and process&nbsp;your data please see our main <a href="https://www.gov.scot/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="How we report consultation findings" id="How we report consultation findings"></a>How we report consultation findings</h3>

                  <p>A good consultation should be transparent in showing what people have said and how these views have been considered by decision-makers. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>One of the main ways we do this is on the “<a href="https://consult.gov.scot/we_asked_you_said/">We Asked, You Said, We Did” section</a> of our consultation website. This briefly summaries the main points of the consultation (We Asked”), how many responses there were and key messages coming out of the responses (“You Said”) and what we have done, or plan to do as a result of the consultation (“We did”).&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>More detail on the responses received will be found in the full consultation analysis report which will be published and available on our website. Most recently published consultation reports are highlighted in our <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/about/">mailing list</a>. In addition, where permission was given to publish them, individual consultation responses are normally made available on our consultation hub.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>We aim to report back within the same length of time as people were given to respond to the consultation,.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The way consultation responses shape decisions and are reported varies depending on the type of the consultation. A single consultation may need a number of different outputs to meet the needs of the policy process, the needs of the audience and to provide effective feedback to respondents.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Once the consultation responses have been analysed, we will publish a statement of what has been done or is going to be done and why and how the consultation has informed these decisions. This publication could be, for example, the final version of a new strategy, the announcement of a new policy position, or plans for new legislation. The output from the analysis of your consultation responses will be used by the Scottish Parliament, its committees and other external groups to scrutinise the consultation exercise.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="Benefits and limitations of a consultation&nbsp;" id="Benefits and limitations of a consultation&nbsp;"></a>Benefits and limitations of a consultation&nbsp;</h3>

                  <p>A consultation can tell us about the broad range of views that exist on a particular policy issue. It can also give us lots of detail about why respondents hold those views. Consultations allow respondents to comment on proposed options – telling us what aspects are of the most importance to them, and letting us know if they have any concerns, or what the benefits might be. Respondents can also suggest alternative options. The information collected during a consultation is valuable in shaping policy decisions but needs to also be considered alongside other sources of evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>It can be tempting to think that if a lot of people give their views in a consultation, then this will be representative of the wider population. This is not the case. Respondents to a consultation have actively chosen to participate because they have an interest in the topic. In contrast a representative survey will capture the views of wider spread of citizens with different levels of interest in the topic.&nbsp;</p>

It provides an overview of what consultations are, the principles a good consultation is based on and what processes are involved. The note is aimed at anybody who is interested in the consultation process.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="consultations and what they can be used for" id="consultations and what they can be used for"></a>Consultations and what they can be used for</h3>

                  <p>A consultation is an opportunity for members of the public to comment on plans or ideas which are being considered, and share experiences, knowledge or ideas that help inform decision-makers.</p>

                  <p>When done well, a consultation provides valuable evidence of the range of experiences and opinions, knowledge and ideas regarding a given issue. This can help policymakers improve their decision making.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo0_O-LUIR0&amp;feature=youtu.be">short video summary</a>.</p>

                  <p>Consultations are open for all citizens to reply to. They can vary in size and type, depending on their aims. “General” consultations often attract responses from a wide audience with a general interest in the topic, and can receive a high number of responses. Other consultations are very specific and are only of interest to a small number of professional stakeholders.&nbsp;These are sometimes referred to as “technical” consultations. Only a limited number of people respond to these, often stakeholders, professionals and policy officials with a high level of understanding of the issue.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>For all consultations, those people who respond actively choose to participate because they have an interest in the consultation topic. Accordingly, a consultation process cannot be used to indicate levels of public support for a proposal or represent the views of the wider public.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>Why we consult</h4>

                  <p>Engaging with people and stakeholder organisations is a key part of the Scottish approach to policymaking. Consultation is an essential and important aspect of our public engagement.</p>

                  <p>Consultations can be used to:</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>inform the development of a particular policy</li>
                   <li>help decisions to be made between alternative policy proposals</li>
                   <li>finalise new legislation before it is implemented</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Consultation enables us to ask a lot of different people about their views. This should &nbsp;improve the policy or law being developed and make sure that it works in the real world. It can expand the pool of expertise contributing to the policymaking process and provides a richer evidence base. It also promotes transparency and legitimacy in the process.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>How we consult</h4>

                  <p>A good consultation should be accessible for people. The consultation should clearly explain what it is seeking people’s views on and make sure that people are able to respond.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>There are many ways in which we consult Scottish citizens and organisations. Consultation can be done using written papers, public meetings, focus groups, questionnaires or online discussion forums. Traditionally, one of the most common ways of consulting is through a written consultation paper. However, this is only one of many ways that policymakers can ask, listen to, and act on, the views of citizens and stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The UK Government sets out 11 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consultation-principles-guidance">principles of good consultation</a>. There are also <a href="https://law.gov.wales/constitution-government/public-admin/intro-admin-law/welsh-government-guidance-on-making-good-decisions/has-any-consultation-been-carried-out-fairly-and-properly/what-are-the-requirements-for-any-consultation-that-is-carried-out/?lang=en">minimum legal standards</a> called The Gunning Principles that a fair and worthwhile exercise must follow. We are committed to being open and transparent via the <a href="https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/">National Performance Framework</a> and the <a href="index">Open Government Action Plan</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Our consultations are mainly done online using our <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/">consultation hub</a>. The consultation hub is a user friendly tool, designed to improve the accessibility and transparency of our consultations. A full listing of open and closed consultations are available on the hub. In addition to that, consultations might be promoted on our social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter and via our <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/about/">mailing list</a>. Sometimes stakeholder groups with an interest in a consultation will let their members know about a consultation and we are often able to accept non-digital responses.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Typically, written consultations present a report laying out the issues under consideration and ask specific questions or for more general views about the topic. Written consultations should provide adequate time for response. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Following the closing date, all responses are analysed and an analysis report is published on <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/">our website</a> and the consultation hub.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>What we consult on</h4>

                  <p>We consult on a wide range of policies, draft bills and regulations. These can include broad policy areas such <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/energy-and-climate-change-directorate/fracking-unconventional-oil-and-gas/">fracking</a>, and <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/animal-welfare/animal-health-welfare-act-amendment-2019/">animal health and welfare</a> as well as more specific issues such as <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/managing-flood-risk/reservoirs-amendment/">amendments to regulations on reservoirs</a> and the <a href="index_1">Land and Buildings Transaction Tax Group Relief</a>. On average, we publish 100 consultations per year.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>When we consult</h4>

                  <p>Consultations can occur at different stages in the policy process, from the development of initial policy ideas through to the finalisation of legislation. There is no set time to hold a consultation – the important thing is that the consultation takes place at an appropriate time, so that responses received can meaningfully inform the decision being made. Consultation will always happen before a final policy decision has been taken.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>Who we consult</h4>

                  <p>A written consultation is open to all people and organisations who wish to express their opinions on a proposed area of work. In other words, anyone who is interested in contributing their views, is encouraged to do so.&nbsp;We use other methods to ensure that people who have an interest in the policy area but do not have the means or opportunity to send a written response, have an opportunity to give views.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>How to respond to a consultation</h4>

                  <p>If you want to respond to a consultation, the most common way to do so is online through our&nbsp;consultation hub. However, it is usually possible to respond in other ways too, such as by email or letter. If consultation events are being held, you might prefer to attend an event rather than provide a written response. Closing dates are clearly advertised on the consultation paper and on the consultation hub website.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Sometimes consultations are available in alternative formats, such as “easy read”, British Sign Language or languages other than English.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The consultation will provide a brief overview of the policy issue being consulted on. It will then ask specific questions or ask for your views on the proposal. Sometimes they include a glossary to make sure people understand the terms being used.</p>

                  <p>If you are completing the consultation on our consultation hub you are able to save and come back to your response. You do not need to complete it all in one go. &nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="What we do with consultation responses" id="What we do with consultation responses"></a>What we do with consultation responses</h3>

                  <h4>Analysis of consultation responses&nbsp;</h4>

                  <p>Once the consultation has closed and responses have been submitted, we need to make sense of the responses so these can inform the policy.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Analysis of responses is necessary to capture and summarise the results. This can be done either internally (within the Scottish Government) or using an external research contractor. Consultation responses will be analysed fairly, rigorously and systematically, regardless of whether they are analysed internally or externally. Consultation analysis findings are normally presented in a written report which is published on our website. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The analysis, and analysis report, reflects the range and breadth of views expressed during the consultation. It&nbsp;identifies key themes emerging from the responses and the arguments behind these. It also describes how many responses were received and provides details on the respondents’ profile if available. &nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>All valid responses are analysed&nbsp;</h4>

                  <p>A response to a consultation is usually considered valid if it is relevant to the subject matter of the consultation.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>Moderation policy&nbsp;</h4>

                  <p>We moderate all responses to ensure that they are appropriate and not offensive or harmful to others. We will analyse all responses, but we will not publish responses which contain material which:</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>raises concerns about data protection or copyright</li>
                   <li>is potentially defamatory</li>
                   <li>has offensive material&nbsp;</li>
                   <li>contains references to on-going court cases</li>
                   <li>impersonates or falsely claims to represent another person or organisation</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Publishing responses</h4>

                  <p>Everyone who responds to a written consultation (the “respondent”) will be asked to fill out a Respondent Information Form (RIF). If responding online, this is on the “About You” page. This asks respondents if they give us permission to publish their response. Respondents can choose to:&nbsp;</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>publish response with name</li>
                   <li>publish response only (without name)</li>
                   <li>do not publish response</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>We will only ever publish a response where we have been given permission to do so. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>These responses will usually be made available to the public at <a href="http://consult.gov.scot">http://consult.gov.scot</a>, alongside the analysis report.</p>

                  <p>The names of organisations responding to consultations will be published.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h4>How we handle personal data</h4>

                  <p>We collect names and email addresses with every response we receive through our <a href="http://consult.gov.scot">consultation platform</a>.</p>

                  <p>Email addresses are used to send an acknowledgement of response following submission. They may also be used to contact you in the future in relation to the consultation exercise if you give consent to be contacted.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Where permission is given, we publish responses. We include <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/">personal data</a> where permission has been given to do so. We never publish email or postal addresses and will delete personal data when the consultation is finished.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>For information on how we collect&nbsp;and process&nbsp;your data please see our main <a href="https://www.gov.scot/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="How we report consultation findings" id="How we report consultation findings"></a>How we report consultation findings</h3>

                  <p>A good consultation should be transparent in showing what people have said and how these views have been considered by decision-makers. &nbsp;</p>

                  <p>One of the main ways we do this is on the “<a href="https://consult.gov.scot/we_asked_you_said/">We Asked, You Said, We Did” section</a> of our consultation website. This briefly summaries the main points of the consultation (We Asked”), how many responses there were and key messages coming out of the responses (“You Said”) and what we have done, or plan to do as a result of the consultation (“We did”).&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>More detail on the responses received will be found in the full consultation analysis report which will be published and available on our website. Most recently published consultation reports are highlighted in our <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/about/">mailing list</a>. In addition, where permission was given to publish them, individual consultation responses are normally made available on our consultation hub.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>We aim to report back within the same length of time as people were given to respond to the consultation,.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The way consultation responses shape decisions and are reported varies depending on the type of the consultation. A single consultation may need a number of different outputs to meet the needs of the policy process, the needs of the audience and to provide effective feedback to respondents.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Once the consultation responses have been analysed, we will publish a statement of what has been done or is going to be done and why and how the consultation has informed these decisions. This publication could be, for example, the final version of a new strategy, the announcement of a new policy position, or plans for new legislation. The output from the analysis of your consultation responses will be used by the Scottish Parliament, its committees and other external groups to scrutinise the consultation exercise.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h3><a name="Benefits and limitations of a consultation&nbsp;" id="Benefits and limitations of a consultation&nbsp;"></a>Benefits and limitations of a consultation&nbsp;</h3>

                  <p>A consultation can tell us about the broad range of views that exist on a particular policy issue. It can also give us lots of detail about why respondents hold those views. Consultations allow respondents to comment on proposed options – telling us what aspects are of the most importance to them, and letting us know if they have any concerns, or what the benefits might be. Respondents can also suggest alternative options. The information collected during a consultation is valuable in shaping policy decisions but needs to also be considered alongside other sources of evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>It can be tempting to think that if a lot of people give their views in a consultation, then this will be representative of the wider population. This is not the case. Respondents to a consultation have actively chosen to participate because they have an interest in the topic. In contrast a representative survey will capture the views of wider spread of citizens with different levels of interest in the topic.&nbsp;</p>

                hippostd:content: |-
                  <p>Thank you very much indeed Presiding Officer.</p>
                  <p>We have reached a critical point in our country’s health, we are seeing growing demand upon our health and social care services that needs addressed alongside an improvement in service performance.</p>
                  <p>The growing demand based on our poor population health which both reduces the wellbeing of Scotland and impacts on the sustainability of our services.</p>
                  <p>This Government is clear that the NHS in Scotland, and the values that underpin its work, is an institution of national pride.</p>
                  <p>And I also recognise the vital role of the social care system in supporting people to manage their health within their communities to live well.</p>
                  <p>The principles of a health service for everyone, owned by the people, and free at the point of delivery, are sacrosanct.</p>
                  <p>Let me be clear that any consideration of abandoning those fundamental values lies beyond a red line that we will not cross.</p>
                  <p>However, while those principles will not change, Scotland itself has changed.</p>
                  <p>The NHS was established 76 years ago to address the health challenges of its time.</p>
                  <p>Now, we live longer, medicines can do much more, technology has transformed the way we live, and our lifestyles have changed. And the treatment of people in hospitals when they are ill is only a small part of modern healthcare.</p>
                  <p>And while this Government is making progress in addressing the challenges of waiting lists, our health and social care services are hard pressed to meet service demand.</p>
                  <p>So today I seek to open a debate of openness, and in good faith, on how we can reform and improve our health services, and how we can collectively deliver a transformed system fit for the health challenges we face.</p>
                  <p>Presiding Officer, I am a pragmatist.</p>
                  <p>We have a clear vision for the direction of reform, which I will shortly outline, and a programme of improvements is already underway.</p>
                  <p>But I am willing also to consider fresh ideas. I am here today asking this Chamber to consider how together we can seize the opportunity to reform health and social care for present and future generations.</p>
                  <p>I have already outlined to my Cabinet colleagues an overarching vision which will guide our work.</p>
                  <p>This vision is one with which no one here could argue: a Scotland where people live longer, healthy and fulfilling lives.</p>
                  <p>This vision is supported by four key areas of work: improving population health, a focus on prevention and early intervention, providing quality services, and maximising access, with all of these underpinned by giving due consideration to the people at the heart of those services.</p>
                  <p>In the short term we must ensure that our services are delivered in the best way we can within our current arrangements, and in the medium term, we need to begin to transform how we work.</p>
                  <p>And we must keep our eyes on the horizon, because in the longer term we also need to fundamentally change how we think about the delivery of health and care, driving investment in prevention and early intervention.</p>
                  <p>Because our vision also reveals the complexity of the task before us: without improving our nation’s general health, no end of service improvements or clinical strategies or refined operating models will be able to make us a healthier nation in the long run.</p>
                  <p>That is why prevention is key.</p>
                  <p>We want to shift the balance of care closer to people’s homes and drive a proactive approach of early intervention and prevention.</p>
                  <p>This will be underpinned by the principles of accessibility, addressing health inequalities, maximising outcomes, and promoting innovation as well as value for money.</p>
                  <p>In urgent and unscheduled care, a lot has already been done, working with the Scottish Ambulance Service, NHS 24 and through the creation of Flow Navigation Centres to manage demand.</p>
                  <p>Our continued investment in Hospital at Home will help to increase the provision of acute care at home and ensure patients receive personalised care.</p>
                  <p>We also need to look at the long-term reforms that are going to be required.</p>
                  <p>We are developing a Population Health Framework, taking a cross-government, cross-sector approach to improve the key building blocks of health.</p>
                  <p>We also must recognise the vital role of social care, and unpaid carers, supporting people to remain in their own homes for longer.</p>
                  <p>And this is a cross govt preventative approach.</p>
                  <p>We are supporting low income households, delivering the Scottish Child Payment, delivering Best Start Bright Futures to tackle child poverty, and expanding free school meals.</p>
                  <p>We will continue minimum unit pricing and to take forward radical action to reduce the harm caused by smoking.</p>
                  <p>I am also clear that, as a nation, all of us need to take personal responsibility and do what we can to mind our own health, pay due attention to nutrition, to our mental health and to exercise – whatever form that may take.</p>
                  <p>Our service reforms must take a whole system approach, including social care and the planned National Care Service.</p>
                  <p>Primary Care, the crucial bedrock of the NHS and the key to driving sustainable, effective, good value for money healthcare, has a well-established collaborative programme of reform and improvement already underway.</p>
                  <p>Primary Care reform is focused around seeing the right person, in the right time, in the right place; and is key to realising a community first approach.</p>
                  <p>So improving access to primary care and shifting care to the community is and must be a key focus of reform.</p>
                  <p>This includes our NHS dental payment reform, free universal NHS-funded eye examinations, our NHS Pharmacy First service – signposting people with common conditions to local pharmacies for advice and treatment.</p>
                  <p>To support general practice, we have significantly expanded the primary care multi-disciplinary team workforce, with over 4,700 staff working in services including physiotherapy, pharmacy and phlebotomy.</p>
                  <p>We are supporting development of these teams through investment of £190m in the Primary Care Improvement Fund this year, as well as continuing to support practice learning time.</p>
                  <p>There are ongoing issues we need to continue to address.</p>
                  <p>People whose discharge from hospital is delayed are not receiving the best care that they need, and this can have significant consequences for them as well as the entire system.</p>
                  <p>We have already put in place the Delayed Discharge and Hospital Occupancy Action Plan to help create necessary capacity.</p>
                  <p>But we still need to improve the flow of patients through our hospitals and will work closely with all stakeholders to achieve this.</p>
                  <p>In 2021 the Independent Review of Adult Social Care showed the clear need for change, recommending a reform of social care in Scotland and strengthening national accountability for social care support.</p>
                  <p>The National Care Service Bill, which will ensure greater transparency in the delivery of community health and social care, improve standards, strengthen the role of the workforce and provide better support for unpaid carers, is the biggest public sector reform since Devolution.</p>
                  <p>People are at the heart of this reform – ending the inconsistency of care provision across Scotland, ensuring those who need it have access to consistently high-quality care and support and instilling Fair Work principles for our workforce.</p>
                  <p>Reform is also taking place within our mental health services, which we will continue to invest in, and will shortly see the publication of the Delivery Plan for the new Mental Health and Capacity Reform Programme.</p>
                  <p>This is the first important step in ensuring that the law, and our policies and practices ensure that anyone who requires support is treated fairly and with dignity.</p>
                  <p>This is just one aspect of our work to improve mental health support at all levels and we will continue to work closely with COLSA, health boards and other partners to implement the delivery plans we published last year.</p>
                  <p>Our valued healthcare workforce is of course a key part to our vision for reform.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the ongoing implementation of Agenda for Change, we are working with the BMA on junior doctor contract reform, and we have launched the Ministerial Taskforce on Nursing and Midwifery, which covers attraction, education and training, retention and staff wellbeing.</p>
                  <p>The Health and Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Act 2019, introduced in April, is the first comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, workforce planning legislation in Scotland – the most comprehensive of its kind in the UK.</p>
                  <p>And we have recognised the vital role of the social care workforce, with a pay uplift to £12 per hour for adult social care workers in commissioned services.</p>
                  <p>Alongside that support for the workforce wellbeing productivity into service, our reforms can and must be accelerated and enriched by the transformative potential of scientific innovation.</p>
                  <p>Last week, the Deputy First Minister and I co-chaired a roundtable on game-changing technologies.</p>
                  <p>The event brought together key leaders from the life science industry as well as academics, the NHS and Government, to discuss advances in science and technology that can transform lives and the implementation of service.</p>
                  <p>Medical research is moving faster than ever, and new preventative technologies are supporting people to better manage their own health better and prevent and mitigate disease.</p>
                  <p>Wearable devices are helping people to take ownership over their own health, while new diagnostic and screening methods can support the NHS identify and treat disease before symptoms appear.</p>
                  <p>There is a huge future potential in personalised and precision medicine and gene therapies as well as robotic surgery.</p>
                  <p>So we will proceed with a new partnership based between Government, the NHS, our academic institutions, and the life sciences industry, focused on seizing opportunities to empower patients, liberate clinicians, drive efficiencies, and prevent ill health.</p>
                  <p>And I am pleased today to announce that five Scottish institutions – the Universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, St Andrews and Strathclyde, as well as Public Health Scotland, have been awarded £1 million of funding each through the Chief Scientist Office to conduct major research programmes into areas of population health in Scotland.</p>
                  <p>The five programmes awarded funding have the potential to make a significant impact.</p>
                  <p>So Presiding Officer, I am aware there are voices in this Chamber who have already called for structural change but I think the urgency of the change required and the focus must be on the transformation of services <br>services within the current structures and maximising current assets.</p>
                  <p>So I will work to implement an NHS Scotland approach, to harness greater levels of collaboration in our health boards and partners, resulting in better value, quality, and outcomes for patients and staff.</p>
                  <p>And that will be led through a government-led national engagement which we must make sure we are fully committed to the series of engagement which will inform our plans, led through a person-centred approach but obviously making sure we utilise the incredible work of our workforce.</p>
                  <p>We have established a Primary and Community Health Steering Group, bringing together a range of stakeholders partners.</p>
                  <p>And an Expert Reference Group will be convened this autumn, providing independent input, advice and an additional independent international perspective.</p>
                  <p>A Stakeholder Advisory Group will also bring together a cross-section of professional associations, COSLA, the ALLIANCE, regulators and others in service delivery. I look forward to hearing directly from them to translate the vision into delivery across the system.</p>
                  <p>We will also listen to all voices and by the end of the year, I hope to have brought them to bear on the actions we take.</p>
                  <p>In conclusion, Presiding Officer, there is no more important issue to a nation than the health of its people.</p>
                  <p>I am not looking to publish another strategy. Our work is already being guided by multiple plans, notably the National Clinical Strategy of 2016.</p>
                  <p>Our task now centres on listening, and delivery.</p>
                  <p>So I am pleased and privileged to open this debate today and welcome all contributions and move the motion in my name.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Thank you very much indeed Presiding Officer.</p>
                  <p>We have reached a critical point in our country’s health, we are seeing growing demand upon our health and social care services that needs addressed alongside an improvement in service performance.</p>
                  <p>The growing demand based on our poor population health which both reduces the wellbeing of Scotland and impacts on the sustainability of our services.</p>
                  <p>This Government is clear that the NHS in Scotland, and the values that underpin its work, is an institution of national pride.</p>
                  <p>And I also recognise the vital role of the social care system in supporting people to manage their health within their communities to live well.</p>
                  <p>The principles of a health service for everyone, owned by the people, and free at the point of delivery, are sacrosanct.</p>
                  <p>Let me be clear that any consideration of abandoning those fundamental values lies beyond a red line that we will not cross.</p>
                  <p>However, while those principles will not change, Scotland itself has changed.</p>
                  <p>The NHS was established 76 years ago to address the health challenges of its time.</p>
                  <p>Now, we live longer, medicines can do much more, technology has transformed the way we live, and our lifestyles have changed. And the treatment of people in hospitals when they are ill is only a small part of modern healthcare.</p>
                  <p>And while this Government is making progress in addressing the challenges of waiting lists, our health and social care services are hard pressed to meet service demand.</p>
                  <p>So today I seek to open a debate of openness, and in good faith, on how we can reform and improve our health services, and how we can collectively deliver a transformed system fit for the health challenges we face.</p>
                  <p>Presiding Officer, I am a pragmatist.</p>
                  <p>We have a clear vision for the direction of reform, which I will shortly outline, and a programme of improvements is already underway.</p>
                  <p>But I am willing also to consider fresh ideas. I am here today asking this Chamber to consider how together we can seize the opportunity to reform health and social care for present and future generations.</p>
                  <p>I have already outlined to my Cabinet colleagues an overarching vision which will guide our work.</p>
                  <p>This vision is one with which no one here could argue: a Scotland where people live longer, healthy and fulfilling lives.</p>
                  <p>This vision is supported by four key areas of work: improving population health, a focus on prevention and early intervention, providing quality services, and maximising access, with all of these underpinned by giving due consideration to the people at the heart of those services.</p>
                  <p>In the short term we must ensure that our services are delivered in the best way we can within our current arrangements, and in the medium term, we need to begin to transform how we work.</p>
                  <p>And we must keep our eyes on the horizon, because in the longer term we also need to fundamentally change how we think about the delivery of health and care, driving investment in prevention and early intervention.</p>
                  <p>Because our vision also reveals the complexity of the task before us: without improving our nation’s general health, no end of service improvements or clinical strategies or refined operating models will be able to make us a healthier nation in the long run.</p>
                  <p>That is why prevention is key.</p>
                  <p>We want to shift the balance of care closer to people’s homes and drive a proactive approach of early intervention and prevention.</p>
                  <p>This will be underpinned by the principles of accessibility, addressing health inequalities, maximising outcomes, and promoting innovation as well as value for money.</p>
                  <p>In urgent and unscheduled care, a lot has already been done, working with the Scottish Ambulance Service, NHS 24 and through the creation of Flow Navigation Centres to manage demand.</p>
                  <p>Our continued investment in Hospital at Home will help to increase the provision of acute care at home and ensure patients receive personalised care.</p>
                  <p>We also need to look at the long-term reforms that are going to be required.</p>
                  <p>We are developing a Population Health Framework, taking a cross-government, cross-sector approach to improve the key building blocks of health.</p>
                  <p>We also must recognise the vital role of social care, and unpaid carers, supporting people to remain in their own homes for longer.</p>
                  <p>And this is a cross govt preventative approach.</p>
                  <p>We are supporting low income households, delivering the Scottish Child Payment, delivering Best Start Bright Futures to tackle child poverty, and expanding free school meals.</p>
                  <p>We will continue minimum unit pricing and to take forward radical action to reduce the harm caused by smoking.</p>
                  <p>I am also clear that, as a nation, all of us need to take personal responsibility and do what we can to mind our own health, pay due attention to nutrition, to our mental health and to exercise – whatever form that may take.</p>
                  <p>Our service reforms must take a whole system approach, including social care and the planned National Care Service.</p>
                  <p>Primary Care, the crucial bedrock of the NHS and the key to driving sustainable, effective, good value for money healthcare, has a well-established collaborative programme of reform and improvement already underway.</p>
                  <p>Primary Care reform is focused around seeing the right person, in the right time, in the right place; and is key to realising a community first approach.</p>
                  <p>So improving access to primary care and shifting care to the community is and must be a key focus of reform.</p>
                  <p>This includes our NHS dental payment reform, free universal NHS-funded eye examinations, our NHS Pharmacy First service – signposting people with common conditions to local pharmacies for advice and treatment.</p>
                  <p>To support general practice, we have significantly expanded the primary care multi-disciplinary team workforce, with over 4,700 staff working in services including physiotherapy, pharmacy and phlebotomy.</p>
                  <p>We are supporting development of these teams through investment of £190m in the Primary Care Improvement Fund this year, as well as continuing to support practice learning time.</p>
                  <p>There are ongoing issues we need to continue to address.</p>
                  <p>People whose discharge from hospital is delayed are not receiving the best care that they need, and this can have significant consequences for them as well as the entire system.</p>
                  <p>We have already put in place the Delayed Discharge and Hospital Occupancy Action Plan to help create necessary capacity.</p>
                  <p>But we still need to improve the flow of patients through our hospitals and will work closely with all stakeholders to achieve this.</p>
                  <p>In 2021 the Independent Review of Adult Social Care showed the clear need for change, recommending a reform of social care in Scotland and strengthening national accountability for social care support.</p>
                  <p>The National Care Service Bill, which will ensure greater transparency in the delivery of community health and social care, improve standards, strengthen the role of the workforce and provide better support for unpaid carers, is the biggest public sector reform since Devolution.</p>
                  <p>People are at the heart of this reform – ending the inconsistency of care provision across Scotland, ensuring those who need it have access to consistently high-quality care and support and instilling Fair Work principles for our workforce.</p>
                  <p>Reform is also taking place within our mental health services, which we will continue to invest in, and will shortly see the publication of the Delivery Plan for the new Mental Health and Capacity Reform Programme.</p>
                  <p>This is the first important step in ensuring that the law, and our policies and practices ensure that anyone who requires support is treated fairly and with dignity.</p>
                  <p>This is just one aspect of our work to improve mental health support at all levels and we will continue to work closely with COLSA, health boards and other partners to implement the delivery plans we published last year.</p>
                  <p>Our valued healthcare workforce is of course a key part to our vision for reform.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the ongoing implementation of Agenda for Change, we are working with the BMA on junior doctor contract reform, and we have launched the Ministerial Taskforce on Nursing and Midwifery, which covers attraction, education and training, retention and staff wellbeing.</p>
                  <p>The Health and Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Act 2019, introduced in April, is the first comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, workforce planning legislation in Scotland – the most comprehensive of its kind in the UK.</p>
                  <p>And we have recognised the vital role of the social care workforce, with a pay uplift to £12 per hour for adult social care workers in commissioned services.</p>
                  <p>Alongside that support for the workforce wellbeing productivity into service, our reforms can and must be accelerated and enriched by the transformative potential of scientific innovation.</p>
                  <p>Last week, the Deputy First Minister and I co-chaired a roundtable on game-changing technologies.</p>
                  <p>The event brought together key leaders from the life science industry as well as academics, the NHS and Government, to discuss advances in science and technology that can transform lives and the implementation of service.</p>
                  <p>Medical research is moving faster than ever, and new preventative technologies are supporting people to better manage their own health better and prevent and mitigate disease.</p>
                  <p>Wearable devices are helping people to take ownership over their own health, while new diagnostic and screening methods can support the NHS identify and treat disease before symptoms appear.</p>
                  <p>There is a huge future potential in personalised and precision medicine and gene therapies as well as robotic surgery.</p>
                  <p>So we will proceed with a new partnership based between Government, the NHS, our academic institutions, and the life sciences industry, focused on seizing opportunities to empower patients, liberate clinicians, drive efficiencies, and prevent ill health.</p>
                  <p>And I am pleased today to announce that five Scottish institutions – the Universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, St Andrews and Strathclyde, as well as Public Health Scotland, have been awarded £1 million of funding each through the Chief Scientist Office to conduct major research programmes into areas of population health in Scotland.</p>
                  <p>The five programmes awarded funding have the potential to make a significant impact.</p>
                  <p>So Presiding Officer, I am aware there are voices in this Chamber who have already called for structural change but I think the urgency of the change required and the focus must be on the transformation of services <br>services within the current structures and maximising current assets.</p>
                  <p>So I will work to implement an NHS Scotland approach, to harness greater levels of collaboration in our health boards and partners, resulting in better value, quality, and outcomes for patients and staff.</p>
                  <p>And that will be led through a government-led national engagement which we must make sure we are fully committed to the series of engagement which will inform our plans, led through a person-centred approach but obviously making sure we utilise the incredible work of our workforce.</p>
                  <p>We have established a Primary and Community Health Steering Group, bringing together a range of stakeholders partners.</p>
                  <p>And an Expert Reference Group will be convened this autumn, providing independent input, advice and an additional independent international perspective.</p>
                  <p>A Stakeholder Advisory Group will also bring together a cross-section of professional associations, COSLA, the ALLIANCE, regulators and others in service delivery. I look forward to hearing directly from them to translate the vision into delivery across the system.</p>
                  <p>We will also listen to all voices and by the end of the year, I hope to have brought them to bear on the actions we take.</p>
                  <p>In conclusion, Presiding Officer, there is no more important issue to a nation than the health of its people.</p>
                  <p>I am not looking to publish another strategy. Our work is already being guided by multiple plans, notably the National Clinical Strategy of 2016.</p>
                  <p>Our task now centres on listening, and delivery.</p>
                  <p>So I am pleased and privileged to open this debate today and welcome all contributions and move the motion in my name.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>There are ongoing issues we need to continue to address.</p>
                  <p>People whose discharge from hospital is delayed are not receiving the best care that they need, and this can have significant consequences for them as well as the entire system.</p>
                  <p>We have already put in place the Delayed Discharge and Hospital Occupancy Action Plan to help create necessary capacity.</p>
                  <p>But we still need to improve the flow of patients through our hospitals and will work closely with all stakeholders to achieve this.</p>
                  <p>In 2021 the Independent Review of Adult Social Care showed the clear need for change, recommending a reform of social care in Scotland and strengthening national accountability for social care support.</p>
                  <p>The National Care Service Bill, which will ensure greater transparency in the delivery of community health and social care, improve standards, strengthen the role of the workforce and provide better support for unpaid carers, is the biggest public sector reform since Devolution.</p>
                  <p>People are at the heart of this reform – ending the inconsistency of care provision across Scotland, ensuring those who need it have access to consistently high-quality care and support and instilling Fair Work principles for our workforce.</p>
                  <p>Reform is also taking place within our mental health services, which we will continue to invest in, and will shortly see the publication of the Delivery Plan for the new Mental Health and Capacity Reform Programme.</p>
                  <p>This is the first important step in ensuring that the law, and our policies and practices ensure that anyone who requires support is treated fairly and with dignity.</p>
                  <p>This is just one aspect of our work to improve mental health support at all levels and we will continue to work closely with COLSA, health boards and other partners to implement the delivery plans we published last year.</p>
                  <p>Our valued healthcare workforce is of course a key part to our vision for reform.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the ongoing implementation of Agenda for Change, we are working with the BMA on junior doctor contract reform, and we have launched the Ministerial Taskforce on Nursing and Midwifery, which covers attraction, education and training, retention and staff wellbeing.</p>
                  <p>The Health and Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Act 2019, introduced in April, is the first comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, workforce planning legislation in Scotland – the most comprehensive of its kind in the UK.</p>
                  <p>And we have recognised the vital role of the social care workforce, with a pay uplift to £12 per hour for adult social care workers in commissioned services.</p>
                  <p>Alongside that support for the workforce wellbeing productivity into service, our reforms can and must be accelerated and enriched by the transformative potential of scientific innovation.</p>
                  <p>Last week, the Deputy First Minister and I co-chaired a roundtable on game-changing technologies.</p>
                  <p>The event brought together key leaders from the life science industry as well as academics, the NHS and Government, to discuss advances in science and technology that can transform lives and the implementation of service.</p>
                  <p>Medical research is moving faster than ever, and new preventative technologies are supporting people to better manage their own health better and prevent and mitigate disease.</p>
                  <p>Wearable devices are helping people to take ownership over their own health, while new diagnostic and screening methods can support the NHS identify and treat disease before symptoms appear.</p>
                  <p>There is a huge future potential in personalised and precision medicine and gene therapies as well as robotic surgery.</p>
                  <p>So we will proceed with a new partnership based between Government, the NHS, our academic institutions, and the life sciences industry, focused on seizing opportunities to empower patients, liberate clinicians, drive efficiencies, and prevent ill health.</p>
                  <p>And I am pleased today to announce that five Scottish institutions – the Universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, St Andrews and Strathclyde, as well as Public Health Scotland, have been awarded £1 million of funding each through the Chief Scientist Office to conduct major research programmes into areas of population health in Scotland.</p>
                  <p>The five programmes awarded funding have the potential to make a significant impact.</p>
                  <p>So Presiding Officer, I am aware there are voices in this Chamber who have already called for structural change but I think the urgency of the change required and the focus must be on the transformation of services <br>services within the current structures and maximising current assets.</p>
                  <p>So I will work to implement an NHS Scotland approach, to harness greater levels of collaboration in our health boards and partners, resulting in better value, quality, and outcomes for patients and staff.</p>
                  <p>And that will be led through a government-led national engagement which we must make sure we are fully committed to the series of engagement which will inform our plans, led through a person-centred approach but obviously making sure we utilise the incredible work of our workforce.</p>
                  <p>We have established a Primary and Community Health Steering Group, bringing together a range of stakeholders partners.</p>
                  <p>And an Expert Reference Group will be convened this autumn, providing independent input, advice and an additional independent international perspective.</p>
                  <p>A Stakeholder Advisory Group will also bring together a cross-section of professional associations, COSLA, the ALLIANCE, regulators and others in service delivery. I look forward to hearing directly from them to translate the vision into delivery across the system.</p>
                  <p>We will also listen to all voices and by the end of the year, I hope to have brought them to bear on the actions we take.</p>
                  <p>In conclusion, Presiding Officer, there is no more important issue to a nation than the health of its people.</p>
                  <p>I am not looking to publish another strategy. Our work is already being guided by multiple plans, notably the National Clinical Strategy of 2016.</p>
                  <p>Our task now centres on listening, and delivery.</p>
                  <p>So I am pleased and privileged to open this debate today and welcome all contributions and move the motion in my name.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Thank you, Presiding Officer for the opportunity to address the Chamber today on the Stage 3 debate on the Bankruptcy and Diligence (Scotland) Bill.</p>
                  <p>I would like to thank the convener, and members of the Economy and Fair Work Committee for their assiduous scrutiny of the Bill during Stages 1 and 2, and for their ongoing support for the measures and small number of amendments we have made.</p>
                  <p>I would also like to thank the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee for their input and everyone that gave evidence during the different stages of the Bill.</p>
                  <p>Very importantly I would like to give a big thanks to Scottish Government officials – the accountant, bankruptcy and legal colleagues in the Scottish Government – for helping guide me through this process having picked up the Bill in its later stages.</p>
                  <p>Finally, I would like to thank my predecessor, Tom Arthur, for his hard work, dedication and commitment to the development of this Bill.</p>
                  <p>This is a focused Bill which makes small but important improvements. And I believe this is reflective of the fact that our bankruptcy system here in Scotland is widely perceived as meeting our needs.</p>
                  <p>More importantly, however, it represents a chance to make things better for a number of individuals with both serious mental health issues and problem debt. By creating the enabling power to establish a Mental Health Moratorium through regulations, this will help improve the lives of those who are struggling with debt and serious mental health issues.</p>
                  <p>The development of this Bill has been a good example of co-production.</p>
                  <p>The initial provisions in the Bill were developed from the recommendations of stakeholder-led groups who reviewed each of the statutory debt solutions to determine what improvements could be made. The provisions have been subject to extensive public consultation and reflect stakeholder recommendations that have achieved a level of consensus.</p>
                  <p>The Bill has been further developed during the stages of the Bill process where we have listened to feedback from Committee members, particularly in their Stage 1 report, and stakeholders to make further amendments to improve the Bill.</p>
                  <p>For the Mental Health Moratorium, we promised and delivered a draft set of Regulations to the Economy and Fair Work Committee prior to stage 3 of this Bill. In doing so, we provided them with the opportunity to see the policy intention of the Mental Health Moratorium. In particular, we have listened to their concerns about the eligibility criteria – and have widened it to allow more people access to the scheme.</p>
                  <p>We will continue to engage with stakeholders as we further develop the Regulations. This will include a public consultation giving stakeholders and Parliament the opportunity to continue to shape them into a scheme that will help the most vulnerable in our society. We will work with the advice and mental health sectors to develop clear guidance and training to ensure a successful delivery of the mental health moratorium. And we will work with them to ensure the tools they need are available.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, we lodged amendments which were agreed to today which ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to fully scrutinise the Regulations that will establish the Mental Health Moratorium. We have also made a statutory commitment in the Bill to a undertake a review of the Mental Health moratorium after 5 years of its introduction - where a full report will be published and presented to Scottish Ministers.</p>
                  <p>We have implemented the Economy and Fair Work Committee’s recommendations and introduced provisions which will allow a private Insolvency Practitioner to be discharged as trustee where the debtor has been non-cooperative and there are no further actions the trustee can take. We have also clarified the law to provide that for a successful petition for recall within the first 6 months of a sequestration, debts can be paid in full without interest being charged but thereafter interest would have to be paid on those debts.</p>
                  <p>We have listened to the witnesses who raised concerns with the Committee. After further engagement with sheriff officers we have developed the provisions that provides them with more time to cite the individual to appear at a sequestration hearing as well as allowing them to serve arrestment schedules electronically. This will help make the process more efficient, cost effective and up to date with modern times.</p>
                  <p>We are aware that the topic of arrestment of funds is of great interest and the issue does require some clarity – particularly around protecting funds wholly derived from social security payments. As mentioned in our earlier session we commit to consult on this and take the time to consider all views to ensure that we get it right and ensure the measures taken do not have any unintended consequences.</p>
                  <p>There are some other matters, raised by stakeholders in their evidence to the Committee which can be addressed through secondary legislation that we will continue to look at. This includes matters such as the minimum period for reapplying for bankruptcy under the Minimal Asset Process and the minimum protected balance for earnings arrestments. As my predecessor said to the Committee, these are things that can be addressed in secondary legislation and that, I think, is the best way to address them.</p>
                  <p>It is also important to note that this Bill is part of a wider programme of reform, and we have commissioned an independent review to assess how far current statutory solutions meet the needs of a modern economy. This work is being taken forward by Yvonne MacDermid, OBE. Yvonne brings a wealth of experience to this work having served as Chief Executive at Money Advice Scotland for many years. Yvonne has now issued a public consultation document to receive feedback on the current solutions and will be reporting back to Scottish Ministers on the results in due course. I look forward to seeing this and continuing to work to make sure our statutory debt solutions are fit for purpose.</p>
                  <p>Moving forward the real work starts here and I look forward to working with Parliament, members of the Committee and our stakeholders to help ensure that Scotland’s statutory debt solutions meet the needs of the people of Scotland. Particularly the most vulnerable in our society suffering from serious mental health issues with problem debt.</p>
                  <p>I commend the Bill to Parliament and I move that the Parliament agrees to the Bankruptcy and Diligence (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>

                  <p>We are aware that the topic of arrestment of funds is of great interest and the issue does require some clarity – particularly around protecting funds wholly derived from social security payments. As mentioned in our earlier session we commit to consult on this and take the time to consider all views to ensure that we get it right and ensure the measures taken do not have any unintended consequences.</p>
                  <p>There are some other matters, raised by stakeholders in their evidence to the Committee which can be addressed through secondary legislation that we will continue to look at. This includes matters such as the minimum period for reapplying for bankruptcy under the Minimal Asset Process and the minimum protected balance for earnings arrestments. As my predecessor said to the Committee, these are things that can be addressed in secondary legislation and that, I think, is the best way to address them.</p>
                  <p>It is also important to note that this Bill is part of a wider programme of reform, and we have commissioned an independent review to assess how far current statutory solutions meet the needs of a modern economy. This work is being taken forward by Yvonne MacDermid, OBE. Yvonne brings a wealth of experience to this work having served as Chief Executive at Money Advice Scotland for many years. Yvonne has now issued a public consultation document to receive feedback on the current solutions and will be reporting back to Scottish Ministers on the results in due course. I look forward to seeing this and continuing to work to make sure our statutory debt solutions are fit for purpose.</p>
                  <p>Moving forward the real work starts here and I look forward to working with Parliament, members of the Committee and our stakeholders to help ensure that Scotland’s statutory debt solutions meet the needs of the people of Scotland. Particularly the most vulnerable in our society suffering from serious mental health issues with problem debt.</p>
                  <p>I commend the Bill to Parliament and I move that the Parliament agrees to the Bankruptcy and Diligence (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>

                  <p>Thank you, Presiding Officer for the opportunity to address the Chamber today on the Stage 3 debate on the Bankruptcy and Diligence (Scotland) Bill.</p>
                  <p>I would like to thank the convener, and members of the Economy and Fair Work Committee for their assiduous scrutiny of the Bill during Stages 1 and 2, and for their ongoing support for the measures and small number of amendments we have made.</p>
                  <p>I would also like to thank the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee for their input and everyone that gave evidence during the different stages of the Bill.</p>
                  <p>Very importantly I would like to give a big thanks to Scottish Government officials – the accountant, bankruptcy and legal colleagues in the Scottish Government – for helping guide me through this process having picked up the Bill in its later stages.</p>
                  <p>Finally, I would like to thank my predecessor, Tom Arthur, for his hard work, dedication and commitment to the development of this Bill.</p>
                  <p>This is a focused Bill which makes small but important improvements. And I believe this is reflective of the fact that our bankruptcy system here in Scotland is widely perceived as meeting our needs.</p>
                  <p>More importantly, however, it represents a chance to make things better for a number of individuals with both serious mental health issues and problem debt. By creating the enabling power to establish a Mental Health Moratorium through regulations, this will help improve the lives of those who are struggling with debt and serious mental health issues.</p>
                  <p>The development of this Bill has been a good example of co-production.</p>
                  <p>The initial provisions in the Bill were developed from the recommendations of stakeholder-led groups who reviewed each of the statutory debt solutions to determine what improvements could be made. The provisions have been subject to extensive public consultation and reflect stakeholder recommendations that have achieved a level of consensus.</p>
                  <p>The Bill has been further developed during the stages of the Bill process where we have listened to feedback from Committee members, particularly in their Stage 1 report, and stakeholders to make further amendments to improve the Bill.</p>
                  <p>For the Mental Health Moratorium, we promised and delivered a draft set of Regulations to the Economy and Fair Work Committee prior to stage 3 of this Bill. In doing so, we provided them with the opportunity to see the policy intention of the Mental Health Moratorium. In particular, we have listened to their concerns about the eligibility criteria – and have widened it to allow more people access to the scheme.</p>
                  <p>We will continue to engage with stakeholders as we further develop the Regulations. This will include a public consultation giving stakeholders and Parliament the opportunity to continue to shape them into a scheme that will help the most vulnerable in our society. We will work with the advice and mental health sectors to develop clear guidance and training to ensure a successful delivery of the mental health moratorium. And we will work with them to ensure the tools they need are available.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, we lodged amendments which were agreed to today which ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to fully scrutinise the Regulations that will establish the Mental Health Moratorium. We have also made a statutory commitment in the Bill to a undertake a review of the Mental Health moratorium after 5 years of its introduction - where a full report will be published and presented to Scottish Ministers.</p>
                  <p>We have implemented the Economy and Fair Work Committee’s recommendations and introduced provisions which will allow a private Insolvency Practitioner to be discharged as trustee where the debtor has been non-cooperative and there are no further actions the trustee can take. We have also clarified the law to provide that for a successful petition for recall within the first 6 months of a sequestration, debts can be paid in full without interest being charged but thereafter interest would have to be paid on those debts.</p>
                  <p>We have listened to the witnesses who raised concerns with the Committee. After further engagement with sheriff officers we have developed the provisions that provides them with more time to cite the individual to appear at a sequestration hearing as well as allowing them to serve arrestment schedules electronically. This will help make the process more efficient, cost effective and up to date with modern times.</p>
                  <p>We are aware that the topic of arrestment of funds is of great interest and the issue does require some clarity – particularly around protecting funds wholly derived from social security payments. As mentioned in our earlier session we commit to consult on this and take the time to consider all views to ensure that we get it right and ensure the measures taken do not have any unintended consequences.</p>
                  <p>There are some other matters, raised by stakeholders in their evidence to the Committee which can be addressed through secondary legislation that we will continue to look at. This includes matters such as the minimum period for reapplying for bankruptcy under the Minimal Asset Process and the minimum protected balance for earnings arrestments. As my predecessor said to the Committee, these are things that can be addressed in secondary legislation and that, I think, is the best way to address them.</p>
                  <p>It is also important to note that this Bill is part of a wider programme of reform, and we have commissioned an independent review to assess how far current statutory solutions meet the needs of a modern economy.

                    <h2>Ministerial foreword</h2>

                    <p>Addressing the climate emergency and nature crises are fundamental challenges we must all tackle together. Day-to-day we see the impacts they are having on our communities, our society, our economic wellbeing, and our environment – both here in Scotland and globally.</p>

                    <p>How we view and treat our resources in Scotland is integral to addressing these crises. Around four-fifths of Scotland’s carbon footprint comes from the products and services we manufacture, use and throw away. While progress has been made, we still need to cut our emissions significantly and to achieve this we must drive a societal shift to reduce the demand for things we use and throw-away. The best way to reduce waste is to not create it in the first place and everyone can play a role in moving towards a circular economy where resources are kept in use for as long as possible.</p>

                    <p>In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of single-use disposable beverage cups in Scotland, rising from around 200 million in 2018 to an estimated 388.7 million in 2021-22. This equates to 71 single-use disposable beverage cups per capita per year, one of the highest rates compared to nations in the&nbsp;EU. They create 5,400 tonnes of waste in Scotland each year, are a symbol of our throwaway culture and a visible sign of litter. Keep Scotland Beautiful’s Litter Survey in 2023 found the majority of people (53%) frequently see littered single-use disposable beverage cups<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/charging-single-use-disposable-beverage-cups-consultation/pages/6/">[1]</a>.</p>

                    <p>The Circular Economy (Scotland) Bill, passed unanimously by the Scottish Parliament in June 2024, gives Scottish Ministers new powers to require suppliers of single-use items to charge a minimum amount for such items, through the introduction of a new section 87A into the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/charging-single-use-disposable-beverage-cups-consultation/pages/6/">[2]</a>, with the policy aim of reducing consumption and therefore reducing the environmental harm caused<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/charging-single-use-disposable-beverage-cups-consultation/pages/6/">[3]</a>. The Scottish Government intends that an early use of such powers will be to introduce a minimum charge on single-use disposable beverage cups. This is in line with our draft Circular Economy and Waste Route Map which includes ‘reduce and reuse’ as one of the four strategic aims, with a commitment to introduce a charge on single-use disposable beverage cups by the end of 2025.</p>

                    <p>Our commitment to tackle consumption of these single-use items builds on the work of the independent Expert Panel on Environmental Charging and Other Measures. Its 2019 report made a number of recommendations to tackle the dependence on, and environmental impact of, single-use disposable beverage cups in Scotland, including the introduction of a national mandatory charge. Since then, we have worked with a range of stakeholders, including through the Single-Use Disposable Beverage Cups Charge Advisory Group, to help inform the development of this policy and I am grateful to them for working in partnership to inform initial proposals. We will continue to listen to stakeholders’ views to ensure any scheme is practical, effective and proportionate. This consultation will inform future decisions about our approach to the charge and how it will work in practice for consumers and businesses.</p>

                    <p>We want to build on the success of the single use carrier bag charge introduced in 2014 – it demonstrated that a charge can raise awareness, change behaviour and promote responsible consumption. A charge for single-use disposable beverage cups will therefore be modelled on this approach, where appropriate, as it will be familiar and has been shown to be effective. I am also committed to implementing this in a way which aligns with our New Deal for Business principles, minimising any burdens as much as possible while achieving the overall objective of reducing our reliance on single-use items.</p>

                    <p>This consultation will help us develop an approach to drive responsible consumption and reuse as part of our wider efforts to build a greener, more sustainable Scotland.</p>

We will continue to listen to stakeholders’ views to ensure any scheme is practical, effective and proportionate. This consultation will inform future decisions about our approach to the charge and how it will work in practice for consumers and businesses.</p>

                    <p>We want to build on the success of the single use carrier bag charge introduced in 2014 – it demonstrated that a charge can raise awareness, change behaviour and promote responsible consumption. A charge for single-use disposable beverage cups will therefore be modelled on this approach, where appropriate, as it will be familiar and has been shown to be effective. I am also committed to implementing this in a way which aligns with our New Deal for Business principles, minimising any burdens as much as possible while achieving the overall objective of reducing our reliance on single-use items.</p>

                    <p>This consultation will help us develop an approach to drive responsible consumption and reuse as part of our wider efforts to build a greener, more sustainable Scotland.</p>

                    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <h3>The consultation and who responded</h3>
                    <p>In July 2024, the Scottish Government launched a <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/justice/media-reporting-on-child-homicide-victims/">public consultation</a> on reporting on child homicide victims. This was prompted by concerns raised by bereaved families about the traumatic impact of intense and continuing press and social media coverage of the death of their loved ones as a result of a crime, particularly child victims of homicide.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the consultation was to gather views so that next steps could be informed by a wide range of insights and experiences.</p>
                    <p>There were 46 responses to the consultation. Of these almost two-thirds (30) were received from groups/organisations and one third (16) were received from individuals. The largest category of respondent was media organisations, who submitted 11 of the responses.</p>
                    <p>A breakdown of responses according to respondent category is provided on page 11 and a list of all organisations that submitted a response to the consultation and agreed to have their name published is included in <a href="a960e55f-5d04-4469-a30a-99e781cb8302">Annex A</a>. Where permission has been received to do so, responses have been published on the <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/justice/media-reporting-on-child-homicide-victims/">Scottish Government website</a>.</p>
                    <p>As respondents to public consultations are self-selecting, the analysis presented in this report cannot be considered to be representative of the wider population.</p>
                    <h3>Summary of findings</h3>
                    <p>The consultation invited views on a range of possible approaches - both legislative and non-legislative - to reducing the trauma that media reporting has on bereaved families, and on the impacts those approaches might have.</p>
                    <p>Overall, throughout the consultation there was a general split in opinion between media organisations, and individuals who have been bereaved and victim support organisations. Respondents’ views were particularly polarised on whether legislating for anonymity was the appropriate action to take, and none of the four options set out in the consultation paper was supported by a majority of respondents.</p>
                    <h4>Reflections on current reporting approaches</h4>
                    <p><strong> Impact of media coverage on the bereaved</strong></p>
                    <p>Respondents recognised the grief and trauma of losing a child, especially in such tragic circumstances. Some, particularly individuals who had been bereaved and victim support organisations, told us that this trauma was compounded, and further distress was caused, by the way in which the death of the child had been covered by the media. Particular concern was expressed about the impact on surviving child siblings.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents questioned extending anonymity specifically to child victims of homicide, suggesting that the same impact of media coverage may be felt by the bereaved where the victim is over 18, or a victim of other crime types.</p>
                    <p><strong> Behaviour of the media and the manner of reporting</strong></p>
                    <p>Many respondents who had been bereaved and victim support organisations, suggested that the general approach of some media outlets both before a story is published and the manner and tone of the reporting itself can be problematic. These respondents specifically raised unnecessary and graphic details in reporting, and the ongoing nature of coverage, as features of the media response causing families to have to re-live their trauma.</p>
                    <p>However, many respondents (including some of those that were strongly in favour of an extension of anonymity) were of the view that, on the whole, the Scottish media operates responsibly and ethically with sensitivity and compassion.</p>
                    <p><strong> Role of the media</strong></p>
                    <p>The vast majority of responses from media organisations commented on the positive role the media outlets have as the “watchdogs of democracy” with many raising that reporting on child homicide cases can be a powerful tool to:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>correct inaccuracies (particularly those that may circulate on social media) and confirm facts</li>
                     <li>raise awareness</li>
                     <li>scrutinise and hold systems and institutions to account</li>
                     <li>provoke meaningful change in society</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some commented on the media’s role specifically within the criminal justice system, including for police appeals for information; holding perpetrators to account; and aiding public confidence in the justice system. It was also suggested that media is the key mechanism by which the public are informed about, and understand, the workings of the justice system.</p>
                    <p>However, many respondents were of the view that coverage of these cases is problematic, questioned the agenda of the media and suggested it was to sell newspapers, get “likes” or make a profit rather than for reporting in the public interest.</p>
                    <p><strong> Current regulation and guidelines </strong></p>
                    <p>The current system of media regulation in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> was referred to in many responses and views were split on if it is sufficient.</p>
                    <p>All responses from media organisations spoke positively of the current system of regulation which they thought provides adequate protection, while also being flexible. Respondents also raised that the current regulatory system is generally complied with.</p>
                    <p>However, other respondents commented that it is a voluntary and self-regulating system which lacks guidance specifically on reporting on child homicide cases. Respondents also raised that it is only applicable to “traditional” forms of media.</p>
                    <h4>Overall views on potential options</h4>
                    <p>Respondents were asked to what extent they supported the following options:</p>
                    <p>1. No anonymity restrictions (i.e. the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit</p>
                    <p>2. Full anonymity restrictions (no waiver)</p>
                    <p>3. Automatic anonymity with option to waive</p>
                    <p>4. No automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit)</p>
                    <p>Overall, the results were mixed and there was no one option that all respondents were clearly in favour of. However, it is clear that option 2, full anonymity with no waiver, received the least amount of support from respondents.</p>
                    <p><strong> 1. No anonymity restrictions (i.e. the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit</strong></p>
                    <p>There was no outright majority view on this option. Most who agreed with this option (13 out of 27) were respondents from media organisations. However, this support was often caveated with many respondents stating that they would need further information about the “authorship, content or status” of a media toolkit.</p>
                    <p>The majority of respondents that disagreed with this option (10 out of 27) were bereaved individuals and victim support organisations, as many did not think non-legislative measures alone would be effective.</p>
                    <p>Other respondents thought that the status quo should remain and no non-legislative actions should be taken.</p>
                    <p>For a media toolkit to be useful and effective, many respondents suggested those with experience and expertise should be involved, including bereaved families, victim support organisations, criminal justice agencies, and journalists.</p>
                    <p>Respondents considered that any media toolkit should be “victim-centred” and “trauma-informed” and should emphasise empathy, dignity, the privacy of those bereaved and the importance of factual reporting.</p>
                    <p>Specific suggestions for what should be included in a toolkit included guidance on language used, the traumatic impact coverage can have on those bereaved, limiting detail, use of photos, repetition of coverage at later dates, and content/trigger warnings.</p>
                    <p><strong> 2. Full anonymity restrictions (no waiver)</strong></p>
                    <p>This option received the least amount of support from respondents with only one supporting it. The main reasons given by respondents for disagreeing with this option were: it would not be a workable solution, it would be disproportionate, it would restrict the freedom of expression of the media and also of those bereaved and would not provide them with any choice or control.</p>
                    <p><strong> 3. Automatic anonymity with option to waive</strong></p>
                    <p>Respondents were almost evenly split over the option of automatic anonymity with the option to waive.</p>
                    <p>The majority of respondents that agreed with this option (16 out of 31) were bereaved individuals, victim support organisations and children’s organisations. The main reasons for support were: it is proportionate and enforceable and it allows the bereaved some choice and control.</p>
                    <p>The majority of respondents that disagreed with this option (15 out of 31) were media organisations. The main reasons for disagreement were: it is not workable, it is not necessary or proportionate, it could still result in over-criminalisation.</p>
                    <p>In terms of how a waiver should operate, the option with most support from respondents (9 out of 25) was that family members should be able to waive the child’s anonymity without applying for a court order, but that this should not cause the reporting restrictions on others to fall away: anyone else who wished to publish identifying information would still need to seek permission from the family.</p>
                    <p>However, some victim support organisations expressed concerns about a waiver process that did not have judicial oversight. Many respondents also commented on the difficulties in defining family members for these purposes, and noted the difficulties presented when family members did not share a unified view.</p>
                    <p>Due to these complexities, and the low number of such cases, some respondents suggested the question of who had the right to waive anonymity could be considered on a case-by case basis by the court. However, others considered that a court process could be cumbersome, expensive and potentially re-traumatising for families.</p>
                    <p><strong> 4. No automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit)</strong></p>
                    <p>Of those that responded to this option, the majority disagreed (22 out of 29) and very few were supportive (3 out of 29). The main reasons given by respondents for disagreeing with this option were: an application process would put an undue and unreasonable burden on those bereaved and grieving, and the court process for an application would be too slow to keep up with the news cycle.</p>
                    <p><strong> Start point for anonymity </strong></p>
                    <p>If anonymity for deceased child victims was introduced in any form, the option that had the most support from respondents (12 out of 25) was that anonymity should start from the point of a child’s death (when it is established that criminality is involved).</p>
                    <p>Reasons given included: any later would be too late as information may already have been released and once details are in the public domain it is difficult/impossible to remove them, and this option would provide protection and choice/control for those bereaved from the earliest point when they are at their most vulnerable.</p>
                    <h4>Other non-legislative options</h4>
                    <p>Suggestions of other non-legislative means of improving how child homicides are reported and information published included:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>a separate toolkit for those who have been bereaved to support them in navigating the media interest in, and coverage of, the case and provide information on their rights</li>
                     <li>publicising the impact media coverage can have on those who have been bereaved with the sharing of lived experience</li>
                     <li>more proactive and joint communication between justice agencies and families about what the media might report</li>
                     <li>specialist media training on trauma-informed reporting</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Potential impact of anonymity for child homicide victims</h4>
                    <p><strong> Bereaved talking about loss</strong></p>
                    <p>It was commonly raised by respondents, across all categories, that not all of those who have been bereaved will respond in the same way to media coverage and if, and how, they wish to talk publicly about their loss will also be unique. Many reasons individuals may wish to talk publicly were identified, including as part of their grieving process, to raise awareness, to campaign for change, to fundraise, and to memorialise and celebrate the life of their loved one.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised concerns about the negative impact on friends and family if a strict approach to anonymity was introduced. Comments included:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>this would breach the right to freedom of expression of those individuals</li>
                     <li>the risk and proportionality of criminalising grieving family and friends if they were to share information about the victim</li>
                     <li>the negative experience of those bereaved in other jurisdictions where anonymity provisions have been introduced</li>
                     <li>family and friends would have to anonymise themselves due to the risk of jigsaw identification.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, other respondents, more commonly victim support organisations and individuals who had been bereaved, commented on the positive impact anonymity with the option for it to be waived could have and often raised the choice and control this would give those bereaved.</p>
                    <p>Others were of the view that even if there was a process to waive anonymity this could still have unintended consequences, further complications and a negative impact on those bereaved. These respondents commented: that family members and friends will likely have differing views on speaking publicly, particularly given the complexities of modern families, and the views of individuals can change over time.</p>
                    <p><strong> Police investigation</strong></p>
                    <p>The media can play an important role in assisting with police investigations, as their coverage of crimes can raise public awareness of an investigation and assist in bringing forward witnesses. Some media respondents suggested that without the name of the victim, any media coverage may be less effective and the audience are likely to be less engaged.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents referred to situations that start as a missing child case, with widespread publicity to aid the search, but then develop into homicide cases, and suggested that introducing reporting restrictions at that point could then impede the police in gathering further information from potential witnesses.</p>
                    <p>However, other respondents noted that anonymity is managed effectively in other circumstances, for example where the accused is a child or for child victims of sexual offences.</p>
                    <p><strong> Freedom of expression</strong></p>
                    <p>The impact an extension of anonymity would have on freedom of expression was a significant concern for all media organisation respondents, with some warning that it could be legally challengeable as non-compliant with Articles 8 (right to respect for private and family life) and 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘<abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>’).</p>
                    <p>Many respondents raised that an extension of anonymity would not only restrict the freedom of expression of the media but would also directly impact individuals, including those that had been bereaved, from talking publicly about their loss.</p>
                    <p>However, many respondents noted that freedom of expression is a qualified right and that restrictions to it can be justified in some circumstances.</p>
                    <p><strong> Whose rights are being protected</strong></p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised the importance of being clear on whose rights are being protected when considering the extension of anonymity to child victims of homicide and which are the priority: the deceased child, surviving child siblings, other family members, the general public or the media. Many respondents referred to the protection of fundamental rights under the <abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr> and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (<abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child">UNCRC</abbr>).</p>
                    <p><strong> Open justice</strong></p>
                    <p>All media organisations felt strongly that an extension to anonymity would have an extremely negative impact on open justice.<a href="jxxxxxx-xx.htm"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Some respondents raised that as the perpetrators of child homicides are most commonly parents, in these cases the perpetrator would also have to be afforded anonymity due to the risk of jigsaw identification.<a href="jxxxxxx-xx.htm"><sup>[2]</sup></a> This was seen to compound the impact that anonymity for child homicide victims would have on open justice.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that thought an extension to anonymity would not impact on open justice, it was often raised that anonymity would not prevent the cases from being reported on. Some respondents also referred to examples of anonymity for other individuals and case types including where the accused is under 18 and also victims of sexual offences.</p>
                    <h4>Public understanding of provisions</h4>
                    <p>Many respondents were of the view that if anonymity provisions were introduced then wider public understanding of the provisions would be of high importance, particularly as breach of the provisions would be a criminal offence resulting in a penalty. However, a number of respondents suggested achieving this would be challenging, with some even stating it would be impossible.</p>
                    <p>Some highlighted that many individuals may not recognise that their own use of social media would be covered by any anonymity provisions, not just traditional forms of media. Therefore if, due to this lack of understanding, they were to share prohibited information online this would risk undermining the restrictions.</p>
                    <h4>Enforcement of anonymity and social media</h4>
                    <p>In respect of the main challenges to enforcing anonymity restrictions, the most commonly raised themes were:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>social media</li>
                     <li>the lack of public knowledge of the law</li>
                     <li>the potential for over-criminalisation of individuals acting with good intentions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The most commonly suggested penalty for breaching an anonymity restriction was a fine, with some respondents suggesting that this should be higher for media organisations than for individual members of the public.</p>
                    <p><strong> Cross-border application</strong></p>
                    <p>Of those that addressed this issue in their response, a majority (20 out of 27) agreed that any extension of anonymity to deceased child victims in Scotland would need to apply to the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to be effective. The general view was that otherwise any provisions would be “unmanageable and completely ineffective” and “virtually impossible to implement and impose”.</p>
                    <h4>Other themes</h4>
                    <p>Other key themes raised in responses were:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li><strong>Public interest</strong>: Some respondents, particularly media organisations, were of the view that transparent reporting on child homicide cases, including the name of the victim, is in the public interest. However, other respondents raised that there is a difference between what is in the public interest and what the public are interested in, and that they are not entitled to know every detail in the name of public interest.</li>
                     <li><strong>The small number of child homicide cases</strong>: some respondents referred to this as a reason why these crimes draw so much attention but others expressed concern, on behalf of those bereaved, that this is often used as a justification for increased media coverage. Many responses from media organisations stated that the small number of cases was a specific reason not to legislate for anonymity as this would be a disproportionate response.</li>
                     <li><strong>Case examples</strong>: Many respondents, in order to put their views in context, referred to specific cases of child homicide. These have not been referred to directly in this analysis to avoid re-traumatisation of bereaved families who may read this report. However, the variety of case examples given do illustrate the wide range of circumstances in which child homicides take place and the complexities that are often involved.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <h3>The consultation and who responded</h3>
                    <p>In July 2024, the Scottish Government launched a <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/justice/media-reporting-on-child-homicide-victims/">public consultation</a> on reporting on child homicide victims. This was prompted by concerns raised by bereaved families about the traumatic impact of intense and continuing press and social media coverage of the death of their loved ones as a result of a crime, particularly child victims of homicide.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the consultation was to gather views so that next steps could be informed by a wide range of insights and experiences.</p>
                    <p>There were 46 responses to the consultation. Of these almost two-thirds (30) were received from groups/organisations and one third (16) were received from individuals. The largest category of respondent was media organisations, who submitted 11 of the responses.</p>
                    <p>A breakdown of responses according to respondent category is provided on page 11 and a list of all organisations that submitted a response to the consultation and agreed to have their name published is included in <a href="a960e55f-5d04-4469-a30a-99e781cb8302">Annex A</a>. Where permission has been received to do so, responses have been published on the <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/justice/media-reporting-on-child-homicide-victims/">Scottish Government website</a>.</p>
                    <p>As respondents to public consultations are self-selecting, the analysis presented in this report cannot be considered to be representative of the wider population.</p>
                    <h3>Summary of findings</h3>
                    <p>The consultation invited views on a range of possible approaches - both legislative and non-legislative - to reducing the trauma that media reporting has on bereaved families, and on the impacts those approaches might have.</p>
                    <p>Overall, throughout the consultation there was a general split in opinion between media organisations, and individuals who have been bereaved and victim support organisations. Respondents’ views were particularly polarised on whether legislating for anonymity was the appropriate action to take, and none of the four options set out in the consultation paper was supported by a majority of respondents.</p>
                    <h4>Reflections on current reporting approaches</h4>
                    <p><strong> Impact of media coverage on the bereaved</strong></p>
                    <p>Respondents recognised the grief and trauma of losing a child, especially in such tragic circumstances. Some, particularly individuals who had been bereaved and victim support organisations, told us that this trauma was compounded, and further distress was caused, by the way in which the death of the child had been covered by the media. Particular concern was expressed about the impact on surviving child siblings.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents questioned extending anonymity specifically to child victims of homicide, suggesting that the same impact of media coverage may be felt by the bereaved where the victim is over 18, or a victim of other crime types.</p>
                    <p><strong> Behaviour of the media and the manner of reporting</strong></p>
                    <p>Many respondents who had been bereaved and victim support organisations, suggested that the general approach of some media outlets both before a story is published and the manner and tone of the reporting itself can be problematic. These respondents specifically raised unnecessary and graphic details in reporting, and the ongoing nature of coverage, as features of the media response causing families to have to re-live their trauma.</p>
                    <p>However, many respondents (including some of those that were strongly in favour of an extension of anonymity) were of the view that, on the whole, the Scottish media operates responsibly and ethically with sensitivity and compassion.</p>
                    <p><strong> Role of the media</strong></p>
                    <p>The vast majority of responses from media organisations commented on the positive role the media outlets have as the “watchdogs of democracy” with many raising that reporting on child homicide cases can be a powerful tool to:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>correct inaccuracies (particularly those that may circulate on social media) and confirm facts</li>
                     <li>raise awareness</li>
                     <li>scrutinise and hold systems and institutions to account</li>
                     <li>provoke meaningful change in society</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some commented on the media’s role specifically within the criminal justice system, including for police appeals for information; holding perpetrators to account; and aiding public confidence in the justice system. It was also suggested that media is the key mechanism by which the public are informed about, and understand, the workings of the justice system.</p>
                    <p>However, many respondents were of the view that coverage of these cases is problematic, questioned the agenda of the media and suggested it was to sell newspapers, get “likes” or make a profit rather than for reporting in the public interest.</p>
                    <p><strong> Current regulation and guidelines </strong></p>
                    <p>The current system of media regulation in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> was referred to in many responses and views were split on if it is sufficient.</p>
                    <p>All responses from media organisations spoke positively of the current system of regulation which they thought provides adequate protection, while also being flexible. Respondents also raised that the current regulatory system is generally complied with.</p>
                    <p>However, other respondents commented that it is a voluntary and self-regulating system which lacks guidance specifically on reporting on child homicide cases. Respondents also raised that it is only applicable to “traditional” forms of media.</p>
                    <h4>Overall views on potential options</h4>
                    <p>Respondents were asked to what extent they supported the following options:</p>
                    <p>1. No anonymity restrictions (i.e. the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit</p>
                    <p>2. Full anonymity restrictions (no waiver)</p>
                    <p>3. Automatic anonymity with option to waive</p>
                    <p>4. No automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit)</p>
                    <p>Overall, the results were mixed and there was no one option that all respondents were clearly in favour of. However, it is clear that option 2, full anonymity with no waiver, received the least amount of support from respondents.</p>
                    <p><strong> 1. No anonymity restrictions (i.e. the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit</strong></p>
                    <p>There was no outright majority view on this option. Most who agreed with this option (13 out of 27) were respondents from media organisations. However, this support was often caveated with many respondents stating that they would need further information about the “authorship, content or status” of a media toolkit.</p>
                    <p>The majority of respondents that disagreed with this option (10 out of 27) were bereaved individuals and victim support organisations, as many did not think non-legislative measures alone would be effective.</p>
                    <p>Other respondents thought that the status quo should remain and no non-legislative actions should be taken.</p>
                    <p>For a media toolkit to be useful and effective, many respondents suggested those with experience and expertise should be involved, including bereaved families, victim support organisations, criminal justice agencies, and journalists.</p>
                    <p>Respondents considered that any media toolkit should be “victim-centred” and “trauma-informed” and should emphasise empathy, dignity, the privacy of those bereaved and the importance of factual reporting.</p>
                    <p>Specific suggestions for what should be included in a toolkit included guidance on language used, the traumatic impact coverage can have on those bereaved, limiting detail, use of photos, repetition of coverage at later dates, and content/trigger warnings.</p>
                    <p><strong> 2. Full anonymity restrictions (no waiver)</strong></p>
                    <p>This option received the least amount of support from respondents with only one supporting it. The main reasons given by respondents for disagreeing with this option were: it would not be a workable solution, it would be disproportionate, it would restrict the freedom of expression of the media and also of those bereaved and would not provide them with any choice or control.</p>
                    <p><strong> 3. Automatic anonymity with option to waive</strong></p>
                    <p>Respondents were almost evenly split over the option of automatic anonymity with the option to waive.</p>
                    <p>The majority of respondents that agreed with this option (16 out of 31) were bereaved individuals, victim support organisations and children’s organisations. The main reasons for support were: it is proportionate and enforceable and it allows the bereaved some choice and control.</p>
                    <p>The majority of respondents that disagreed with this option (15 out of 31) were media organisations. The main reasons for disagreement were: it is not workable, it is not necessary or proportionate, it could still result in over-criminalisation.</p>
                    <p>In terms of how a waiver should operate, the option with most support from respondents (9 out of 25) was that family members should be able to waive the child’s anonymity without applying for a court order, but that this should not cause the reporting restrictions on others to fall away: anyone else who wished to publish identifying information would still need to seek permission from the family.</p>
                    <p>However, some victim support organisations expressed concerns about a waiver process that did not have judicial oversight. Many respondents also commented on the difficulties in defining family members for these purposes, and noted the difficulties presented when family members did not share a unified view.</p>
                    <p>Due to these complexities, and the low number of such cases, some respondents suggested the question of who had the right to waive anonymity could be considered on a case-by case basis by the court. However, others considered that a court process could be cumbersome, expensive and potentially re-traumatising for families.</p>
                    <p><strong> 4. No automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit)</strong></p>
                    <p>Of those that responded to this option, the majority disagreed (22 out of 29) and very few were supportive (3 out of 29). The main reasons given by respondents for disagreeing with this option were: an application process would put an undue and unreasonable burden on those bereaved and grieving, and the court process for an application would be too slow to keep up with the news cycle.</p>
                    <p><strong> Start point for anonymity </strong></p>
                    <p>If anonymity for deceased child victims was introduced in any form, the option that had the most support from respondents (12 out of 25) was that anonymity should start from the point of a child’s death (when it is established that criminality is involved).</p>
                    <p>Reasons given included: any later would be too late as information may already have been released and once details are in the public domain it is difficult/impossible to remove them, and this option would provide protection and choice/control for those bereaved from the earliest point when they are at their most vulnerable.</p>
                    <h4>Other non-legislative options</h4>
                    <p>Suggestions of other non-legislative means of improving how child homicides are reported and information published included:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>a separate toolkit for those who have been bereaved to support them in navigating the media interest in, and coverage of, the case and provide information on their rights</li>
                     <li>publicising the impact media coverage can have on those who have been bereaved with the sharing of lived experience</li>
                     <li>more proactive and joint communication between justice agencies and families about what the media might report</li>
                     <li>specialist media training on trauma-informed reporting</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Potential impact of anonymity for child homicide victims</h4>
                    <p><strong> Bereaved talking about loss</strong></p>
                    <p>It was commonly raised by respondents, across all categories, that not all of those who have been bereaved will respond in the same way to media coverage and if, and how, they wish to talk publicly about their loss will also be unique. Many reasons individuals may wish to talk publicly were identified, including as part of their grieving process, to raise awareness, to campaign for change, to fundraise, and to memorialise and celebrate the life of their loved one.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised concerns about the negative impact on friends and family if a strict approach to anonymity was introduced. Comments included:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>this would breach the right to freedom of expression of those individuals</li>
                     <li>the risk and proportionality of criminalising grieving family and friends if they were to share information about the victim</li>
                     <li>the negative experience of those bereaved in other jurisdictions where anonymity provisions have been introduced</li>
                     <li>family and friends would have to anonymise themselves due to the risk of jigsaw identification.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, other respondents, more commonly victim support organisations and individuals who had been bereaved, commented on the positive impact anonymity with the option for it to be waived could have and often raised the choice and control this would give those bereaved.</p>
                    <p>Others were of the view that even if there was a process to waive anonymity this could still have unintended consequences, further complications and a negative impact on those bereaved. These respondents commented: that family members and friends will likely have differing views on speaking publicly, particularly given the complexities of modern families, and the views of individuals can change over time.</p>
                    <p><strong> Police investigation</strong></p>
                    <p>The media can play an important role in assisting with police investigations, as their coverage of crimes can raise public awareness of an investigation and assist in bringing forward witnesses. Some media respondents suggested that without the name of the victim, any media coverage may be less effective and the audience are likely to be less engaged.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents referred to situations that start as a missing child case, with widespread publicity to aid the search, but then develop into homicide cases, and suggested that introducing reporting restrictions at that point could then impede the police in gathering further information from potential witnesses.</p>
                    <p>However, other respondents noted that anonymity is managed effectively in other circumstances, for example where the accused is a child or for child victims of sexual offences.</p>
                    <p><strong> Freedom of expression</strong></p>
                    <p>The impact an extension of anonymity would have on freedom of expression was a significant concern for all media organisation respondents, with some warning that it could be legally challengeable as non-compliant with Articles 8 (right to respect for private and family life) and 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘<abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>’).</p>
                    <p>Many respondents raised that an extension of anonymity would not only restrict the freedom of expression of the media but would also directly impact individuals, including those that had been bereaved, from talking publicly about their loss.</p>
                    <p>However, many respondents noted that freedom of expression is a qualified right and that restrictions to it can be justified in some circumstances.</p>
                    <p><strong> Whose rights are being protected</strong></p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised the importance of being clear on whose rights are being protected when considering the extension of anonymity to child victims of homicide and which are the priority: the deceased child, surviving child siblings, other family members, the general public or the media. Many respondents referred to the protection of fundamental rights under the <abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr> and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (<abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child">UNCRC</abbr>).</p>
                    <p><strong> Open justice</strong></p>
                    <p>All media organisations felt strongly that an extension to anonymity would have an extremely negative impact on open justice.<a href="jxxxxxx-xx.htm"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Some respondents raised that as the perpetrators of child homicides are most commonly parents, in these cases the perpetrator would also have to be afforded anonymity due to the risk of jigsaw identification.<a href="jxxxxxx-xx.htm"><sup>[2]</sup></a> This was seen to compound the impact that anonymity for child homicide victims would have on open justice.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that thought an extension to anonymity would not impact on open justice, it was often raised that anonymity would not prevent the cases from being reported on. Some respondents also referred to examples of anonymity for other individuals and case types including where the accused is under 18 and also victims of sexual offences.</p>
                    <h4>Public understanding of provisions</h4>
                    <p>Many respondents were of the view that if anonymity provisions were introduced then wider public understanding of the provisions would be of high importance, particularly as breach of the provisions would be a criminal offence resulting in a penalty. However, a number of respondents suggested achieving this would be challenging, with some even stating it would be impossible.</p>
                    <p>Some highlighted that many individuals may not recognise that their own use of social media would be covered by any anonymity provisions, not just traditional forms of media. Therefore if, due to this lack of understanding, they were to share prohibited information online this would risk undermining the restrictions.</p>
                    <h4>Enforcement of anonymity and social media</h4>
                    <p>In respect of the main challenges to enforcing anonymity restrictions, the most commonly raised themes were:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>social media</li>
                     <li>the lack of public knowledge of the law</li>
                     <li>the potential for over-criminalisation of individuals acting with good intentions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The most commonly suggested penalty for breaching an anonymity restriction was a fine, with some respondents suggesting that this should be higher for media organisations than for individual members of the public.</p>
                    <p><strong> Cross-border application</strong></p>
                    <p>Of those that addressed this issue in their response, a majority (20 out of 27) agreed that any extension of anonymity to deceased child victims in Scotland would need to apply to the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to be effective. The general view was that otherwise any provisions would be “unmanageable and completely ineffective” and “virtually impossible to implement and impose”.</p>
                    <h4>Other themes</h4>
                    <p>Other key themes raised in responses were:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li><strong>Public interest</strong>: Some respondents, particularly media organisations, were of the view that transparent reporting on child homicide cases, including the name of the victim, is in the public interest. However, other respondents raised that there is a difference between what is in the public interest and what the public are interested in, and that they are not entitled to know every detail in the name of public interest.</li>
                     <li><strong>The small number of child homicide cases</strong>: some respondents referred to this as a reason why these crimes draw so much attention but others expressed concern, on behalf of those bereaved, that this is often used as a justification for increased media coverage. Many responses from media organisations stated that the small number of cases was a specific reason not to legislate for anonymity as this would be a disproportionate response.</li>
                     <li><strong>Case examples</strong>: Many respondents, in order to put their views in context, referred to specific cases of child homicide. These have not been referred to directly in this analysis to avoid re-traumatisation of bereaved families who may read this report. However, the variety of case examples given do illustrate the wide range of circumstances in which child homicides take place and the complexities that are often involved.</li>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>In July 2024, the Scottish Government launched a <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/justice/media-reporting-on-child-homicide-victims/">public consultation</a> on media reporting on child homicide victims. This was prompted by concerns raised by bereaved families about the traumatic impact of intense and continuing press and social media coverage of the death of their loved ones as a result of a crime, particularly child victims of homicide.</p>
                    <p>It is essential that the policy developed in this area is evidence-based, learns from what has been done in other jurisdictions, and, crucially, listens to the voices of those with lived experience of this issue. The Scottish Government has already taken forward work to develop a body of evidence to inform consideration of these issues, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>an <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/-/media/files/committees/education-children-and-young-people-committee/correspondence/2024/anonymity-for-deceased-child-victims--paper-on-international-examples.pdf">evidence paper</a> looking at the Scottish context and international examples of victim anonymity</li>
                     <li>hosting a roundtable in February 2024 involving victims organisations and media representatives amongst others, and publishing a <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/roundtable-end-point-anonymity-child-victims/">report of the discussion</a></li>
                     <li>engagement with bereaved families</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It was clear from this work that there are a number of complexities and that a fuller understanding of the potential consequences of any change in policy or legislation was required before any decisions were taken on future developments.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the purpose of the consultation was to build on the existing evidence base and draw together views so that next steps can be informed by a wide range of insights and experiences.</p>
                    <p>The consultation was open from 9 July to 1 October 2024. The consultation was also available in an <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/media-reporting-child-homicide-public-consultation-easy-read-version/">Easy Read</a> format, and respondents were invited to respond in a number of different ways, including online, via email and via post. The analysis of responses received was conducted by Scottish Government officials from the Criminal Justice Reform Unit and quality assured by analysts from Justice Analytical Services. The findings from that analysis are presented in this report.</p>
                    <h3>Methodology</h3>
                    <p>The consultation consisted of 24 questions including a number of closed questions, (inviting respondents to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement) and open questions inviting respondents to provide comments.</p>
                    <p>Responses to the consultation were submitted using the Scottish Government’s online consultation platform Citizen Space or by email. Where responses were submitted by email, these were entered manually onto the Citizen Space system to create a complete database of responses. All responses were screened to ensure that they were appropriate and valid. The Citizen Space database, containing all submitted responses, was then exported to a qualitative data analysis software package for detailed analysis.</p>
                    <p>The consultation received a number of ‘campaign plus’ responses. These responses either contain the same or very similar wording as another submitted response as well as some additional detail or comments or they are responses that explicitly state that they “endorse” another submitted response, again with additional detail or comments provided. These ‘campaign plus’ responses are not the same as ‘campaign’ responses which are identical to another submission, with no additional comments or details.</p>
                    <p>In total we received 4 responses that we categorise as ‘campaign plus’. For the purposes of analysis, ‘campaign plus’ responses have been analysed as individual responses on account of them being submitted by different individuals or different organisations and containing distinct detail and/or comments. With regard to the quantitative questions in the consultation, these ‘campaign plus’ responses have also been analysed as individual responses and have been counted in the totals.</p>
                    <p>Not all respondents answered all questions and many provided a response with their overall views addressing their main interests and concerns instead of responding to the specific questions in the consultation paper. Therefore, whilst we state the number of responses for each question presented in this report, this does not always match the total number of respondents. While responses varied in their length and how they were presented, all were treated with the same weight.</p>
                    <p>All comments made by respondents were considered and the issues raised relevant to the consultation topic were grouped into key overarching themes. These themes are explored in this report.</p>
                    <p>Quotations have been included where they illustrate a point of view clearly and every effort has been made to use quotations across the range of respondents. When attributing quotations, names of individuals have not been included but organisations have been named where they have given permission. Where respondents requested anonymity and/or confidentiality, their views were analysed but quotations have not been taken from their responses.</p>
                    <p>As respondents to public consultations are self-selecting, the analysis presented in this report cannot be considered to be representative of the wider population.</p>
                    <h3>Who responded</h3>
                    <p>There were 46 responses to the consultation. Of these almost two-thirds (30) were received from groups/organisations and one third (16) were received from individuals. The largest category of respondent was media organisations who submitted 11 of the responses. 41 respondents gave permission for their responses to be published and 5 did not. Where permission has been received to do so, responses have been published on the <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/justice/media-reporting-on-child-homicide-victims/">Scottish Government website</a>.</p>
                    <p>The table below shows the breakdown of responses, according to respondent category. Respondents were asked to select whether they were individuals or organisations. Individuals were given the option to identify themselves as either interested member of the public, journalist, bereaved family member/friend, legal professional or other and could select more than one category if applicable. The organisations were not asked to identify themselves as belonging to a specific group/type and have been grouped as part of the analysis process.</p>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>In July 2024, the Scottish Government launched a <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/justice/media-reporting-on-child-homicide-victims/">public consultation</a> on media reporting on child homicide victims. This was prompted by concerns raised by bereaved families about the traumatic impact of intense and continuing press and social media coverage of the death of their loved ones as a result of a crime, particularly child victims of homicide.</p>
                    <p>It is essential that the policy developed in this area is evidence-based, learns from what has been done in other jurisdictions, and, crucially, listens to the voices of those with lived experience of this issue. The Scottish Government has already taken forward work to develop a body of evidence to inform consideration of these issues, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>an <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/-/media/files/committees/education-children-and-young-people-committee/correspondence/2024/anonymity-for-deceased-child-victims--paper-on-international-examples.pdf">evidence paper</a> looking at the Scottish context and international examples of victim anonymity</li>
                     <li>hosting a roundtable in February 2024 involving victims organisations and media representatives amongst others, and publishing a <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/roundtable-end-point-anonymity-child-victims/">report of the discussion</a></li>
                     <li>engagement with bereaved families</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It was clear from this work that there are a number of complexities and that a fuller understanding of the potential consequences of any change in policy or legislation was required before any decisions were taken on future developments.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the purpose of the consultation was to build on the existing evidence base and draw together views so that next steps can be informed by a wide range of insights and experiences.</p>
                    <p>The consultation was open from 9 July to 1 October 2024. The consultation was also available in an <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/media-reporting-child-homicide-public-consultation-easy-read-version/">Easy Read</a> format, and respondents were invited to respond in a number of different ways, including online, via email and via post. The analysis of responses received was conducted by Scottish Government officials from the Criminal Justice Reform Unit and quality assured by analysts from Justice Analytical Services. The findings from that analysis are presented in this report.</p>
                    <h3>Methodology</h3>
                    <p>The consultation consisted of 24 questions including a number of closed questions, (inviting respondents to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement) and open questions inviting respondents to provide comments.</p>
                    <p>Responses to the consultation were submitted using the Scottish Government’s online consultation platform Citizen Space or by email. Where responses were submitted by email, these were entered manually onto the Citizen Space system to create a complete database of responses. All responses were screened to ensure that they were appropriate and valid. The Citizen Space database, containing all submitted responses, was then exported to a qualitative data analysis software package for detailed analysis.</p>
                    <p>The consultation received a number of ‘campaign plus’ responses. These responses either contain the same or very similar wording as another submitted response as well as some additional detail or comments or they are responses that explicitly state that they “endorse” another submitted response, again with additional detail or comments provided. These ‘campaign plus’ responses are not the same as ‘campaign’ responses which are identical to another submission, with no additional comments or details.</p>
                    <p>In total we received 4 responses that we categorise as ‘campaign plus’. For the purposes of analysis, ‘campaign plus’ responses have been analysed as individual responses on account of them being submitted by different individuals or different organisations and containing distinct detail and/or comments. With regard to the quantitative questions in the consultation, these ‘campaign plus’ responses have also been analysed as individual responses and have been counted in the totals.</p>
                    <p>Not all respondents answered all questions and many provided a response with their overall views addressing their main interests and concerns instead of responding to the specific questions in the consultation paper. Therefore, whilst we state the number of responses for each question presented in this report, this does not always match the total number of respondents. While responses varied in their length and how they were presented, all were treated with the same weight.</p>
                    <p>All comments made by respondents were considered and the issues raised relevant to the consultation topic were grouped into key overarching themes. These themes are explored in this report.</p>
                    <p>Quotations have been included where they illustrate a point of view clearly and every effort has been made to use quotations across the range of respondents. When attributing quotations, names of individuals have not been included but organisations have been named where they have given permission. Where respondents requested anonymity and/or confidentiality, their views were analysed but quotations have not been taken from their responses.</p>
                    <p>As respondents to public consultations are self-selecting, the analysis presented in this report cannot be considered to be representative of the wider population.</p>
                    <h3>Who responded</h3>
                    <p>There were 46 responses to the consultation. Of these almost two-thirds (30) were received from groups/organisations and one third (16) were received from individuals. The largest category of respondent was media organisations who submitted 11 of the responses. 41 respondents gave permission for their responses to be published and 5 did not. Where permission has been received to do so, responses have been published on the <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/justice/media-reporting-on-child-homicide-victims/">Scottish Government website</a>.</p>
                    <p>The table below shows the breakdown of responses, according to respondent category. Respondents were asked to select whether they were individuals or organisations. Individuals were given the option to identify themselves as either interested member of the public, journalist, bereaved family member/friend, legal professional or other and could select more than one category if applicable. The organisations were not asked to identify themselves as belonging to a specific group/type and have been grouped as part of the analysis process.</p>

                    <p><strong>Question 1: Please share any thoughts you have on how\
                    \ the media currently reports on child homicides.</strong></p>\n\
                    <p>28 respondents responded to this question directly. Other respondents\
                    \ answered this question in comments made throughout their response.\
                    \ The most commonly raised theme was the detrimental impact media\
                    \ coverage has on bereaved families.</p>\n<p>A large number of\
                    \ comments were also received relating to problematic behaviour\
                    \ of the media, particularly the press, and the manner/tone of\
                    \ reporting. However some respondents, particularly those from\
                    \ media organisations, noted the good practice of the majority\
                    \ of outlets. Current regulation of the media and the role of\
                    \ the media were also frequently commented on with mixed views\
                    \ on if it is sufficient.</p>\n<h3>Impact of media coverage on\
                    \ the bereaved</h3>\n<p>The vast majority of respondents, across\
                    \ all types, recognised the grief and trauma of losing a child,\
                    \ especially in such tragic circumstances. Some, particularly\
                    \ individuals who had been bereaved and victim support organisations,\
                    \ went on to comment that this trauma was compounded, and further\
                    \ distress caused, by the way in which the death of the child\
                    \ had been covered by the media. Many described this as being\
                    \ “re-traumatising”.</p>\n<p>“Currently in Scotland, the victim’\
                    s name, photograph, and extremely sensitive details about them\
                    \ and the crime that was committed against them are usually released\
                    \ in the public domain. This causes huge distress and adds to\
                    \ an already deeply traumatic situation.” – individual, bereaved\
                    \ family member or friend</p>\n<p>“this is an incredibly sensitive\
                    \ area and it is clear that, at times, reporting can exacerbate\
                    \ families’ grief if editorial standards are not upheld.” – Independent\
                    \ Press Standards Organisation</p>\n<p>The lack of choice and\
                    \ control family members have over what is reported was also raised\
                    \ by some respondents with many also emphasising the importance\
                    \ of listening to those with lived experience in determining the\
                    \ best route forward.</p>\n<h4>Surviving siblings</h4>\n<p>Of\
                    \ the respondents who were of the view that the media coverage\
                    \ caused further trauma to bereaved families, the majority expressed\
                    \ particular concern about the impact on surviving child siblings.</p>\n\
                    <p>“We cannot overstate the traumatic impact graphic news coverage\
                    \ can have on surviving siblings, who become victims in their\
                    \ own right. It is increasingly challenging to shield children\
                    \ from harmful content as the internet is a daily essential for\
                    \ schoolwork and entertainment. We are told by parents that they\

                    <h4>Other considerations regarding impact</h4>\n<p>The fact that\
                    \ not all cases are the same and that individuals’ experiences\
                    \ of, and reactions to, media coverage will all be different was\
                    \ highlighted by many respondents throughout the consultation\
                    \ responses. For example:</p>\n<p>“some relatives of child homicide\
                    \ victims find the publicity surrounding the child’s death distressing\
                    \ (with variation depending on the nature of the publicity), with\
                    \ there often being particular concern over the impact of publicity\
                    \ on the deceased child’s surviving siblings. Yet other relatives\
                    \ appear to welcome the opportunity to highlight the crime, its\
                    \ impact on them and to share memories about the deceased child.\
                    \ It is quite possible that different members of a given bereaved\
                    \ family will have different views on the issue of publicity.\
                    \ The same comments apply to friends of the deceased child.” –\
                    \ individual, legal professional</p>\n<p>Some respondents questioned\
                    \ extending anonymity specifically to child victims of homicide,\
                    \ suggesting that the same impact may be felt by the bereaved\
                    \ where the victim is over 18 or in other crime types.</p>\n<p>“\
                    If the justification for this proposal is the upset suffered by\
                    \ close family, then there would be justification for extending\
                    \ the \"protection\" if the victim was over 18. Does the family\
                    \ of a 19-year-old murdered in the street by a gang not feel the\
                    \ same anguish as those of a 17-year-old killed in the same circumstances?\
                    \ Similarly, it would be logical to extend such a law to any young\
                    \ person unlawfully killed.” – Newsbrands Scotland</p>\n<h3>Behaviour\
                    \ of the media and the manner of reporting</h3>\n<p>When discussing\
                    \ the impact of media reporting on child homicide victims on those\
                    \ bereaved, many respondents who had been bereaved and support\
                    \ organisations suggested the general approach of some media outlets\
                    \ - both before a story is published and the manner and tone of\
                    \ the reporting - can be problematic:</p>\n<p>“Reporting of all\
                    \ crime types impacts victims and witnesses, but it can be particularly\
                    \ traumatising for the family of a child who dies unexpectedly\
                    \ as a result of crime. This is in part due to the reporting style\
                    \ deployed by some media outlets which can:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Objectify\
                    \ the victim,</li>\n <li>Exploit the family,</li>\n <li>Report\
                    \ in a sensational and simplistic way (ibid.).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Immediately\
                    \ following a child homicide, families can be exposed to a myriad\
                    \ of coverage that can vary greatly in tone and include a range\
                    \ of graphic and unnecessary details.” – Victim Support Scotland\
                    \ and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>\n\
                    <h4>Unnecessary detail</h4>\n<p>Within this theme, a large number\
                    \ of comments were made about unnecessary and graphic details\
                    \ in reporting. Words that were commonly used to describe this\
                    \ coverage included: explicit, graphic, unnecessary, sensationalist,\
                    \ extreme, and gratuitous.</p>\n<p>Specific examples of what was\
                    \ thought to be unnecessary detail included: photographs of the\
                    \ victim (particularly when directly next to photographs of the\
                    \ accused), maps of the last movements of the victim, details\
                    \ about the crime and cause of death (especially those of a sexual\
                    \ and/or violent nature). Some respondents commented that the\
                    \ identity of the child victim was an unnecessary detail and that\
                    \ the crime could still be reported by the media without including\
                    \ this information.</p>\n<p>“Families bereaved by crime should\
                    \ not have to endure exposure to explicit and sensationalised\
                    \ coverage about their loved one’s death. Graphic news coverage\
                    \ can have a traumatic impact on surviving siblings, who become\
                    \ victims in their own right.” - Children 1<sup>st</sup></p>\n\
                    <p>“We acknowledge that reporting on child homicide cases may\
                    \ be in the public interest, however this does not need to include\
                    \ graphic detail e.g., regarding the condition the body was found\
                    \ in or mapping out last known sightings. We firmly believe that\
                    \ such explicit detail is unnecessary and is deeply retraumatising\
                    \ for the family, especially surviving siblings.” – Victim Support\

                    <h4>Ongoing nature of coverage</h4>\n<p>Another commonly raised\
                    \ issue was the ongoing nature of the bereaved being contacted\
                    \ by the media and the subsequent coverage, with words like “\
                    hounding”, “relentless”, “cycle”, “never-ending” and “constant”\
                    \ appearing often in responses. It was suggested that this caused\
                    \ families to have to re-live their trauma.</p>\n<p>“The media\
                    \ absolutely hounds families, friends and communities when there\
                    \ is a child homicide, headline front page stories for months,\
                    \ years constantly barraging families, schools, friends, communities\
                    \ for any type of story and repeatedly using the victims photo\
                    \ next to their murderer.” – individual, bereaved family member\
                    \ or friend</p>\n<h4>Good practice</h4>\n<p>Counter to these views,\
                    \ many respondents (the majority of which being media organisations)\
                    \ were of the view that the Scottish media operates responsibly\
                    \ and ethically, and some respondents further commented that many\
                    \ outlets respect requests from families, particularly those relating\
                    \ to photographs used in coverage. Terms that were used by respondents\
                    \ to describe this included: “sensitivity”, “take responsibility\
                    \ seriously”, “ethical”, “responsible”, “care”, “compassion”,\
                    \ “integrity”.</p>\n<p>“journalists are sons, daughters, mothers\
                    \ and fathers too, and fully understand how traumatic the loss\
                    \ of any child must be, never mind under such horrific circumstances\
                    \ as a murder. As such they take their responsibilities seriously\
                    \ and do not seek to add to any family's anguish in any way.</p>\n\
                    <p>They do reflect the justified outrage and shock felt by the\
                    \ general public when such tragedies occur and the sense of urgency\
                    \ to bring the perpetrator to justice. And publishers are always\
                    \ very willing to help those families who wish to derive something\
                    \ positive from such appalling tragedies.</p>\n<p>News publishers\
                    \ take their responsibilities under the law very seriously and\

                    \ considerable controls to which the reporting of crimes involving\
                    \ children.” – Newsbrands Scotland</p>\n<p>It was also recognised\
                    \ by other non-media respondents that there is a range in approach\
                    \ in how the media cover these cases.</p>\n<h3>Role of the media</h3>\n\
                    <p>The vast majority of responses from media organisations commented\
                    \ on the positive role the media outlets have as the “watchdogs\
                    \ of democracy” with many raising that reporting on child homicide\
                    \ cases can be a powerful tool and effective at:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>correcting\
                    \ inaccuracies (particularly those that may circulate on social\
                    \ media) and confirming facts</li>\n <li>raising awareness</li>\n\
                    \ <li>scrutinising and holding systems and institutions to account</li>\n\
                    \ <li>leading to meaningful change in society</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“\
                    The media plays a critical role not only in reporting on crime\
                    \ as the case unfolds, but in analysing the case after conclusion.\
                    \ An anonymity extension would detrimentally impact the ability\
                    \ of the media to inform the public and, as the watchdogs of democracy,\
                    \ to scrutinise and facilitate accountability. When such crimes\
                    \ lead to inquiries and pressure for institutional changes, they\
                    \ generally do so because of a public outcry. This outcry is usually\
                    \ the result of reporting. Without media scrutiny, the pressure\
                    \ for essential change is likely to diminish - which does not\
                    \ serve relatives or society.” – <abbr title=\"Scottish Television\"\

                    <p>There were further comments on the media’s role specifically\
                    \ within the criminal justice system, for example: for police\
                    \ appeals for information, holding perpetrators to account, and\
                    \ aiding public confidence in the justice system. Some respondents\
                    \ raised that the media were the key mechanism by which the public\
                    \ are informed about, and understand, the workings of the justice\
                    \ system.</p>\n<p>“Generally, the work of the courts must be accessible\
                    \ to the public. Very few members of the public are in a position\

                    \ of those respondents that were of the view that coverage of\
                    \ these cases is problematic, many questioned the agenda of the\
                    \ media, suggesting it was to sell newspapers, get “likes” or\
                    \ make a profit rather than for reporting in the public interest.</p>\n\
                    <p>“There is a clear difference between well intentioned outpourings\

                    \ those that were of the view that the current system of regulation\
                    \ was inadequate, it was often raised in the responses that it\

                    Currently, there is no legislation to moderate media coverage\

                    <p><strong>Question 1: Please share any thoughts you have on how\
                    \ the media currently reports on child homicides.</strong></p>\n\
                    <p>28 respondents responded to this question directly. Other respondents\
                    \ answered this question in comments made throughout their response.\
                    \ The most commonly raised theme was the detrimental impact media\
                    \ coverage has on bereaved families.</p>\n<p>A large number of\
                    \ comments were also received relating to problematic behaviour\
                    \ of the media, particularly the press, and the manner/tone of\
                    \ reporting. However some respondents, particularly those from\
                    \ media organisations, noted the good practice of the majority\
                    \ of outlets. Current regulation of the media and the role of\
                    \ the media were also frequently commented on with mixed views\
                    \ on if it is sufficient.</p>\n<h3>Impact of media coverage on\
                    \ the bereaved</h3>\n<p>The vast majority of respondents, across\
                    \ all types, recognised the grief and trauma of losing a child,\
                    \ especially in such tragic circumstances. Some, particularly\
                    \ individuals who had been bereaved and victim support organisations,\
                    \ went on to comment that this trauma was compounded, and further\
                    \ distress caused, by the way in which the death of the child\
                    \ had been covered by the media. Many described this as being\
                    \ “re-traumatising”.</p>\n<p>“Currently in Scotland, the victim’\
                    s name, photograph, and extremely sensitive details about them\
                    \ and the crime that was committed against them are usually released\
                    \ in the public domain. This causes huge distress and adds to\
                    \ an already deeply traumatic situation.” – individual, bereaved\
                    \ family member or friend</p>\n<p>“this is an incredibly sensitive\
                    \ area and it is clear that, at times, reporting can exacerbate\
                    \ families’ grief if editorial standards are not upheld.” – Independent\
                    \ Press Standards Organisation</p>\n<p>The lack of choice and\
                    \ control family members have over what is reported was also raised\
                    \ by some respondents with many also emphasising the importance\
                    \ of listening to those with lived experience in determining the\
                    \ best route forward.</p>\n<h4>Surviving siblings</h4>\n<p>Of\
                    \ the respondents who were of the view that the media coverage\
                    \ caused further trauma to bereaved families, the majority expressed\
                    \ particular concern about the impact on surviving child siblings.</p>\n\
                    <p>“We cannot overstate the traumatic impact graphic news coverage\
                    \ can have on surviving siblings, who become victims in their\
                    \ own right. It is increasingly challenging to shield children\
                    \ from harmful content as the internet is a daily essential for\
                    \ schoolwork and entertainment. We are told by parents that they\
                    \ live in fear of their surviving children accidently being exposed\
                    \ to age-inappropriate and violent coverage about their sibling’\
                    s case.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration\
                    \ Forum Scotland</p>\n<p>One respondent offered an explanation\
                    \ as to why the impact on surviving children is more acute, citing\
                    \ Adverse Childhood Experiences (<abbr title=\"Adverse Childhood\
                    \ Experiences\">ACE</abbr>s) such as exposure to traumatic experiences\
                    \ and the adverse impact this can have on the development and\
                    \ wellbeing of children and young people:</p>\n<p>“In our experience,\
                    \ children and teenagers exposed to traumatic events such as a\
                    \ loved one’s murder, struggle to understand the effects of trauma,\
                    \ they avoid school, feel isolated, and wanting to resume life\
                    \ as it was before, but readily available graphic details in media,\
                    \ other children’s verbal intrusion, and press publicity about\
                    \ the death of the sibling, can have a huge psychological impact\
                    \ on them which can lead to life-long trauma related issues without\
                    \ the support of professional intervention.” – <abbr title=\"\
                    People Experiencing Trauma and Loss\">PETAL</abbr> Support</p>\n\
                    <h4>Other considerations regarding impact</h4>\n<p>The fact that\
                    \ not all cases are the same and that individuals’ experiences\
                    \ of, and reactions to, media coverage will all be different was\
                    \ highlighted by many respondents throughout the consultation\
                    \ responses. For example:</p>\n<p>“some relatives of child homicide\
                    \ victims find the publicity surrounding the child’s death distressing\
                    \ (with variation depending on the nature of the publicity), with\
                    \ there often being particular concern over the impact of publicity\
                    \ on the deceased child’s surviving siblings. Yet other relatives\
                    \ appear to welcome the opportunity to highlight the crime, its\
                    \ impact on them and to share memories about the deceased child.\
                    \ It is quite possible that different members of a given bereaved\
                    \ family will have different views on the issue of publicity.\
                    \ The same comments apply to friends of the deceased child.” –\
                    \ individual, legal professional</p>\n<p>Some respondents questioned\
                    \ extending anonymity specifically to child victims of homicide,\
                    \ suggesting that the same impact may be felt by the bereaved\
                    \ where the victim is over 18 or in other crime types.</p>\n<p>“\
                    If the justification for this proposal is the upset suffered by\
                    \ close family, then there would be justification for extending\
                    \ the \"protection\" if the victim was over 18. Does the family\
                    \ of a 19-year-old murdered in the street by a gang not feel the\
                    \ same anguish as those of a 17-year-old killed in the same circumstances?\
                    \ Similarly, it would be logical to extend such a law to any young\
                    \ person unlawfully killed.” – Newsbrands Scotland</p>\n<h3>Behaviour\
                    \ of the media and the manner of reporting</h3>\n<p>When discussing\
                    \ the impact of media reporting on child homicide victims on those\
                    \ bereaved, many respondents who had been bereaved and support\
                    \ organisations suggested the general approach of some media outlets\
                    \ - both before a story is published and the manner and tone of\
                    \ the reporting - can be problematic:</p>\n<p>“Reporting of all\
                    \ crime types impacts victims and witnesses, but it can be particularly\
                    \ traumatising for the family of a child who dies unexpectedly\
                    \ as a result of crime. This is in part due to the reporting style\
                    \ deployed by some media outlets which can:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Objectify\
                    \ the victim,</li>\n <li>Exploit the family,</li>\n <li>Report\
                    \ in a sensational and simplistic way (ibid.).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Immediately\
                    \ following a child homicide, families can be exposed to a myriad\
                    \ of coverage that can vary greatly in tone and include a range\
                    \ of graphic and unnecessary details.” – Victim Support Scotland\
                    \ and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>\n\
                    <h4>Unnecessary detail</h4>\n<p>Within this theme, a large number\
                    \ of comments were made about unnecessary and graphic details\
                    \ in reporting. Words that were commonly used to describe this\
                    \ coverage included: explicit, graphic, unnecessary, sensationalist,\
                    \ extreme, and gratuitous.</p>\n<p>Specific examples of what was\
                    \ thought to be unnecessary detail included: photographs of the\
                    \ victim (particularly when directly next to photographs of the\
                    \ accused), maps of the last movements of the victim, details\
                    \ about the crime and cause of death (especially those of a sexual\
                    \ and/or violent nature). Some respondents commented that the\
                    \ identity of the child victim was an unnecessary detail and that\
                    \ the crime could still be reported by the media without including\
                    \ this information.</p>\n<p>“Families bereaved by crime should\
                    \ not have to endure exposure to explicit and sensationalised\
                    \ coverage about their loved one’s death. Graphic news coverage\
                    \ can have a traumatic impact on surviving siblings, who become\
                    \ victims in their own right.” - Children 1<sup>st</sup></p>\n\
                    <p>“We acknowledge that reporting on child homicide cases may\
                    \ be in the public interest, however this does not need to include\
                    \ graphic detail e.g., regarding the condition the body was found\
                    \ in or mapping out last known sightings. We firmly believe that\
                    \ such explicit detail is unnecessary and is deeply retraumatising\
                    \ for the family, especially surviving siblings.” – Victim Support\
                    \ Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>\n\
                    <h4>Ongoing nature of coverage</h4>\n<p>Another commonly raised\
                    \ issue was the ongoing nature of the bereaved being contacted\
                    \ by the media and the subsequent coverage, with words like “\
                    hounding”, “relentless”, “cycle”, “never-ending” and “constant”\
                    \ appearing often in responses. It was suggested that this caused\
                    \ families to have to re-live their trauma.</p>\n<p>“The media\
                    \ absolutely hounds families, friends and communities when there\
                    \ is a child homicide, headline front page stories for months,\
                    \ years constantly barraging families, schools, friends, communities\
                    \ for any type of story and repeatedly using the victims photo\
                    \ next to their murderer.” – individual, bereaved family member\
                    \ or friend</p>\n<h4>Good practice</h4>\n<p>Counter to these views,\
                    \ many respondents (the majority of which being media organisations)\
                    \ were of the view that the Scottish media operates responsibly\
                    \ and ethically, and some respondents further commented that many\
                    \ outlets respect requests from families, particularly those relating\
                    \ to photographs used in coverage. Terms that were used by respondents\
                    \ to describe this included: “sensitivity”, “take responsibility\
                    \ seriously”, “ethical”, “responsible”, “care”, “compassion”,\
                    \ “integrity”.</p>\n<p>“journalists are sons, daughters, mothers\
                    \ and fathers too, and fully understand how traumatic the loss\
                    \ of any child must be, never mind under such horrific circumstances\
                    \ as a murder. As such they take their responsibilities seriously\
                    \ and do not seek to add to any family's anguish in any way.</p>\n\
                    <p>They do reflect the justified outrage and shock felt by the\
                    \ general public when such tragedies occur and the sense of urgency\
                    \ to bring the perpetrator to justice. And publishers are always\
                    \ very willing to help those families who wish to derive something\
                    \ positive from such appalling tragedies.</p>\n<p>News publishers\
                    \ take their responsibilities under the law very seriously and\
                    \ go to great lengths to ensure coverage is compliant with the\
                    \ considerable controls to which the reporting of crimes involving\
                    \ children.” – Newsbrands Scotland</p>\n<p>It was also recognised\
                    \ by other non-media respondents that there is a range in approach\
                    \ in how the media cover these cases.</p>\n<h3>Role of the media</h3>\n\
                    <p>The vast majority of responses from media organisations commented\
                    \ on the positive role the media outlets have as the “watchdogs\
                    \ of democracy” with many raising that reporting on child homicide\
                    \ cases can be a powerful tool and effective at:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>correcting\
                    \ inaccuracies (particularly those that may circulate on social\
                    \ media) and confirming facts</li>\n <li>raising awareness</li>\n\
                    \ <li>scrutinising and holding systems and institutions to account</li>\n\
                    \ <li>leading to meaningful change in society</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“\
                    The media plays a critical role not only in reporting on crime\
                    \ as the case unfolds, but in analysing the case after conclusion.\
                    \ An anonymity extension would detrimentally impact the ability\
                    \ of the media to inform the public and, as the watchdogs of democracy,\
                    \ to scrutinise and facilitate accountability. When such crimes\
                    \ lead to inquiries and pressure for institutional changes, they\
                    \ generally do so because of a public outcry. This outcry is usually\
                    \ the result of reporting. Without media scrutiny, the pressure\

                    \ make a profit rather than for reporting in the public interest.</p>\n\
                    <p>“There is a clear difference between well intentioned outpourings\

                    \ of broadcasting, one regulatory body stated:</p>\n<p>“In our\
                    \ experience, there is a high level of compliance with the rules\

                    <p>Respondents were asked to what extent they supported the four options put forward in the consultation paper. These were:</p>
                    <p>1. No anonymity restrictions (i.e. the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit</p>
                    <p>2. Full anonymity restrictions (no waiver)</p>
                    <p>3. Automatic anonymity with option to waive</p>
                    <p>4. No automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit)</p>
                    <p>As will be shown in more detail below, the results were mixed and there was no one option that all respondents were clearly in favour of. However, it is clear that the option of full anonymity with no waiver received the least amount of support from respondents.</p>

                    <p>The response for the option of no automatic anonymity restrictions but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit) was more negative than positive. Of the 29 respondents that provided an answer to this question, 3 either agreed or strongly agreed, 4 neither agreed or disagreed, and 22 either disagreed or strongly disagreed.</p>
                    <p>The main reasons given by respondents for disagreeing with this option were: an application process would put an undue and unreasonable burden on those bereaved and grieving, and the court process for an application would be too slow to keep up with the news cycle.</p>
                    <p><strong>Question 23: Are there other options you think we should explore?</strong> Please provide details.</p>
                    <p>19 respondents provided an answer to this question directly, many of the comments made have been addressed elsewhere in the report. In response to this question, many media organisations re-iterated their view that they do not think reform is necessary.</p>
                    <p>One respondent suggested consideration of the following option, similar to the approach taken in New South Wales (as is discussed in the Scottish Government’s published <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/-/media/files/committees/education-children-and-young-people-committee/correspondence/2024/anonymity-for-deceased-child-victims--paper-on-international-examples.pdf">review of international approaches to anonymity</a>):</p>
                    <p>“We believe that to try to minimise the potential challenges/unintended consequences of each of the options detailed above, there should be automatic anonymity, with the right for those with parental rights and responsibilities to be able to waive anonymity without requiring a court order. There could be certain caveats to this, possibly enshrined in guidance, such as if there were no surviving parents or the parent was involved in the murder of the child, similar to the approach in New South Wales as outlined in the accompanying evidence paper.</p>
                    <p>The rights and views of surviving siblings should be paramount in decisions. Those with parental rights and responsibilities should seek these children’s views and take them into account when deciding whether to identify the deceased child.</p>
                    <p>We think the involvement of courts in decisions should be minimised given the emotional, time and financial implications of court involvement but deem there should be recourse to court in certain circumstances and at any time…</p>
                    <p>We do not believe that all restrictions should fall at that stage, nor that family members should need to give permission if identifying information is to be re-published as we are concerned that this could result in repeated contact, even hounding for permissions. However, we believe that the individuals who waive anonymity should be able to define what type of information can be published and shared, which can then be republished by others without a criminal offence being committed. This should avoid information that families would not want to be shared, including often graphic information which could potentially be the most traumatising, from being published, thereby maximise the level of control that family members have over what is being shared, without enhancing the burden of requests on families.” - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>

                    <h2>Overall views on potential options</h2>
                    <p><strong>Question 21: To what extent do you support the options discussed in this paper?</strong> Please give reasons for your answer</p>
                    <p>Respondents were asked to what extent they supported the four options put forward in the consultation paper. These were:</p>
                    <p>1. No anonymity restrictions (i.e. the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit</p>
                    <p>2. Full anonymity restrictions (no waiver)</p>
                    <p>3. Automatic anonymity with option to waive</p>
                    <p>4. No automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit)</p>
                    <p>As will be shown in more detail below, the results were mixed and there was no one option that all respondents were clearly in favour of. However, it is clear that the option of full anonymity with no waiver received the least amount of support from respondents.</p>
                    <p><strong>1. No anonymity restrictions (i.e the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit</strong></p>

                    <p>The response for the option of no automatic anonymity restrictions but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit) was more negative than positive. Of the 29 respondents that provided an answer to this question, 3 either agreed or strongly agreed, 4 neither agreed or disagreed, and 22 either disagreed or strongly disagreed.</p>
                    <p>The main reasons given by respondents for disagreeing with this option were: an application process would put an undue and unreasonable burden on those bereaved and grieving, and the court process for an application would be too slow to keep up with the news cycle.</p>
                    <p><strong>Question 23: Are there other options you think we should explore?</strong> Please provide details.</p>
                    <p>19 respondents provided an answer to this question directly, many of the comments made have been addressed elsewhere in the report. In response to this question, many media organisations re-iterated their view that they do not think reform is necessary.</p>
                    <p>One respondent suggested consideration of the following option, similar to the approach taken in New South Wales (as is discussed in the Scottish Government’s published <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/-/media/files/committees/education-children-and-young-people-committee/correspondence/2024/anonymity-for-deceased-child-victims--paper-on-international-examples.pdf">review of international approaches to anonymity</a>):</p>
                    <p>“We believe that to try to minimise the potential challenges/unintended consequences of each of the options detailed above, there should be automatic anonymity, with the right for those with parental rights and responsibilities to be able to waive anonymity without requiring a court order. There could be certain caveats to this, possibly enshrined in guidance, such as if there were no surviving parents or the parent was involved in the murder of the child, similar to the approach in New South Wales as outlined in the accompanying evidence paper.</p>
                    <p>The rights and views of surviving siblings should be paramount in decisions. Those with parental rights and responsibilities should seek these children’s views and take them into account when deciding whether to identify the deceased child.</p>
                    <p>We think the involvement of courts in decisions should be minimised given the emotional, time and financial implications of court involvement but deem there should be recourse to court in certain circumstances and at any time…</p>
                    <p>We do not believe that all restrictions should fall at that stage, nor that family members should need to give permission if identifying information is to be re-published as we are concerned that this could result in repeated contact, even hounding for permissions. However, we believe that the individuals who waive anonymity should be able to define what type of information can be published and shared, which can then be republished by others without a criminal offence being committed. This should avoid information that families would not want to be shared, including often graphic information which could potentially be the most traumatising, from being published, thereby maximise the level of control that family members have over what is being shared, without enhancing the burden of requests on families.” - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>

                    </table>
                    <p>Of the 28 respondents that provided an answer to this question, a majority (16) either agreed or strongly agreed, 7 neither agreed or disagreed and 5 either disagreed or strongly disagreed that a media toolkit could support journalists and editors to report on child homicides in a trauma-informed way.</p>
                    <p>Support for a media toolkit came from across a range of respondent types, some respondents commented that a toolkit (or non-legislative guidance/code of conduct) for reporting on child victims on homicide would support journalists and aid their understanding of what is and is not appropriate to report and could better inform them about the impact their coverage can have on those bereaved.</p>
                    <p>“A reporting toolkit can give guidance which still respects the professionalism of reporters while supporting them to report in a sensitive way. A comprehensive toolkit coupled with strong guidance for journalists can support a nuanced approach to reporting which can balance privacy, safeguarding and issues of public interest.” – Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>Some respondents highlighted examples of existing toolkits and guidance for the media on reporting of other sensitive issues including <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">suicide</a> and <a href="https://www.zerotolerance.org.uk/work-journalists/">violence against women and girls</a>.</p>
                    <p>In order to be useful and effective, many respondents suggested those with experience and expertise should be involved in the development of a media toolkit/guidance. Suggestions for who should be involved included: bereaved families, victim support organisations, criminal justice agencies, and journalists.</p>
                    <p>“<abbr title="Independent Press Standards Organisation">IPSO</abbr> is happy to support this process, but it is not for us as a regulator to set out what should or should not be included. We would recommend the government establishes which principles the toolkit should meet and seek input from victims’ families, police, subject matter experts and journalists on what they would consider helpful. We would be happy to support such a process.” – Independent Press Standards Organisation</p>
                    <p>However, one media organisation stressed that a media toolkit should not be the product of government “to be consistent with freedom of expression”. – Newbrands Scotland</p>
                    <p>The importance of “buy-in” from the media was emphasised by some respondents, with one noting that as well as individual journalists it would be important that the toolkit was also adopted by the senior leadership in media organisations:</p>
                    <p>“However, any such guidelines must also be accepted by editors and news editors, as individual journalists at a scene, and particularly early-career journalists, can face pressure to go beyond ethical boundaries while covering stories.” – National Union of Journalists</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, of those respondents that were in support of a media toolkit some did raise concerns about effectiveness and compliance due a lack of enforceability. Those respondents that did not support a media toolkit also commonly raised issues of enforceability.</p>
                    <p>Some victim support organisations raised that they did not think a media toolkit would alone be sufficient to address the issues experienced by bereaved families and that it should be underpinned by a legislative extension of anonymity.</p>
                    <p>“Whilst a toolkit could help provide some consistent and improved standards across coverage, there remains the risk that this may not be universally adhered to (ibid.).” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>“Anything to help a victims family, but this may have no teeth and could see the same issues arising again and again” – individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p>One respondent suggested that it would be important to ensure that a toolkit did not only apply to traditional forms of media but also to online outlets and social media. Another suggested that a toolkit could have a positive influence on social media users.</p>
                    <p>The concerns noted above were also shared with many of those respondents that answered neutrally or did not answer the question but provided some additional comments.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents noted that a media toolkit might only have a positive impact on those who already report sensitively, and have no impact on those who do not.</p>
                    <p>“A media toolkit might be of assistance to ethical journalists and publishers who are concerned about boundaries. It seems unlikely, however, that it would make any difference to the conduct of unethical journalists in pursuit of “a scoop” or to those individuals who post on social media without any regard for the feelings of others.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>“While certainly worthy of discussion, the parameters of such a toolkit would likely mirror the regulation and self-regulation already in use by responsible media companies. Any less responsible publishing activity would likely ignore the toolkit anyway.” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>Many responses from media organisations reiterated that they would require more information on the “content, authorship and status” of a media toolkit before they could give a view on it.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that did not support a media toolkit, in addition to enforceability, reasons included it would take too long to develop and it is not the place of the government to tell the media how to operate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Question 8: What should such a toolkit cover?</strong></p>
                    <p>27 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Other respondents addressed this issue in comments made throughout their response.</p>
                    <p>There were key recurring themes in respect of the overall principles a media toolkit should cover. These were: it should be “victim-centred” and “trauma-informed” and should emphasise empathy, dignity, the privacy of those bereaved and the importance of factual reporting.</p>
                    <p>More specific suggestions of what should be covered in a toolkit, and how the overall principles/standards could be achieved, included guidance on:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>the language used – it should not be inflammatory or sensationalist</li>
                     <li>the traumatic impact coverage can have on those who have been bereaved - this could include sharing people’s lived experience</li>
                     <li>limiting the detail included – only necessary information should be covered</li>
                     <li>how photos are included, including the importance of consulting the family on preferred photo choice and respecting that decision, not taking photos without permission from social media, and avoiding having victim/perpetrator photos side by side</li>
                     <li>avoidance of the repetition of coverage at later dates, for example on anniversaries, or birthdays</li>
                     <li>including content/trigger warnings for potentially distressing content</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>One respondent referred to <a href="https://www.unicef.org/eca/media/ethical-guidelines">UNICEF’s Guidelines for journalists reporting on children</a> as a helpful example.</p>
                    <p>As covered elsewhere in this report, respondents were also asked to what extent they supported “No anonymity restrictions (i.e. the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit” and to what extent they thought this option was proportionate and enforceable. Further detail can be found at pages 19-20 and 51 respectively.</p>
                    <h3>Other non-legislative options</h3>
                    <p><strong>Question 9: Are there other non-legislative means of improving how child homicides are reported and information published?</strong></p>
                    <p>27 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p>Suggestions of other non-legislative means of improving how child homicides are reported on and information published included:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>a separate toolkit for those who have been bereaved to support them in navigating the media interest in, and coverage of, the case and provide information on their rights</li>
                     <li>publicising the impact media coverage can have on those who have been bereaved with the sharing of lived experience:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>“It would be worth continuing to publicise the negative impact of publicity and of particular kinds of reporting on the families of children who have been homicide victims. At least then those who report such things, whether as journalists or on social media, would be reminded of the harm they may do and, it is to be hoped, reassess what they were tempted to write originally.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>Of the 28 respondents that provided an answer to this question, a majority (18) either agreed or strongly agreed, 5 neither agreed or disagreed and 5 either disagreed or strongly disagreed that the Scottish Government should work with the criminal justice agencies to explore non-legislative options to help reduce the trauma of reporting on bereaved families of child homicide victims.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that agreed that the Scottish Government should work with the criminal justice agencies to explore non-legislative options, some noted the benefits of collaborative working and bringing agencies together, that all options should be explored, and that this should be happening currently.</p>
                    <p>“We have heard from families bereaved by crime that they would also welcome greater, proactive communication between justice agencies and families about what the media might report (ibid.). Measures should be taken to ensure that sensitive information is reaching families directly, before it is announced in the media. Additionally, families should be proactively made aware of their rights surrounding media reporting.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>“It is always better to gain agreement and work with professions in a consensual, collaborative way, legislative options should be a last resort where voluntary agreements have failed to produce a desired outcome… As well as trying to reduce the impact of reporting, full support should be given to families to help them cope at a very difficult time including support from police, victim support, social work and associated services. This will require investment in services to ensure they have both time and appropriate training to effectively support families bereaved through homicide.” - Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>Some victim support organisations suggested that as an official source of information for the media, criminal justice agencies – including Police Scotland, the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service – have a duty to ensure that only necessary information is released, that it is accurate, that it has been released with regard to the impact it may have on the bereaved family and has been shared with them first. Further suggestions included that official press releases could include guidance on respecting the family’s privacy.</p>
                    <p>Some media organisation respondents commented that the matter is “for the Scottish Government and the criminal justice agencies.”</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that disagreed that the Scottish Government should work with the criminal justice agencies to explore non-legislative options, some commented that this was not the role of government, with one individual stating that it would be “a very undemocratic move.”</p>
                    <p>“We do not believe it is for government and the legal system to produce restrictions, statutory or otherwise, which will inevitably impact on freedom of expression or force change on existing non-statutory systems set up to ensure its defence There would be a high risk that rejection of government proposals would result in the introduction of statutory controls.” – Newsbrands Scotland</p>

                    </table>
                    <p>Of the 28 respondents that provided an answer to this question, a majority (16) either agreed or strongly agreed, 7 neither agreed or disagreed and 5 either disagreed or strongly disagreed that a media toolkit could support journalists and editors to report on child homicides in a trauma-informed way.</p>
                    <p>Support for a media toolkit came from across a range of respondent types, some respondents commented that a toolkit (or non-legislative guidance/code of conduct) for reporting on child victims on homicide would support journalists and aid their understanding of what is and is not appropriate to report and could better inform them about the impact their coverage can have on those bereaved.</p>
                    <p>“A reporting toolkit can give guidance which still respects the professionalism of reporters while supporting them to report in a sensitive way. A comprehensive toolkit coupled with strong guidance for journalists can support a nuanced approach to reporting which can balance privacy, safeguarding and issues of public interest.” – Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>Some respondents highlighted examples of existing toolkits and guidance for the media on reporting of other sensitive issues including <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">suicide</a> and <a href="https://www.zerotolerance.org.uk/work-journalists/">violence against women and girls</a>.</p>
                    <p>In order to be useful and effective, many respondents suggested those with experience and expertise should be involved in the development of a media toolkit/guidance. Suggestions for who should be involved included: bereaved families, victim support organisations, criminal justice agencies, and journalists.</p>
                    <p>“<abbr title="Independent Press Standards Organisation">IPSO</abbr> is happy to support this process, but it is not for us as a regulator to set out what should or should not be included. We would recommend the government establishes which principles the toolkit should meet and seek input from victims’ families, police, subject matter experts and journalists on what they would consider helpful. We would be happy to support such a process.” – Independent Press Standards Organisation</p>
                    <p>However, one media organisation stressed that a media toolkit should not be the product of government “to be consistent with freedom of expression”. – Newbrands Scotland</p>
                    <p>The importance of “buy-in” from the media was emphasised by some respondents, with one noting that as well as individual journalists it would be important that the toolkit was also adopted by the senior leadership in media organisations:</p>
                    <p>“However, any such guidelines must also be accepted by editors and news editors, as individual journalists at a scene, and particularly early-career journalists, can face pressure to go beyond ethical boundaries while covering stories.” – National Union of Journalists</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, of those respondents that were in support of a media toolkit some did raise concerns about effectiveness and compliance due a lack of enforceability. Those respondents that did not support a media toolkit also commonly raised issues of enforceability.</p>
                    <p>Some victim support organisations raised that they did not think a media toolkit would alone be sufficient to address the issues experienced by bereaved families and that it should be underpinned by a legislative extension of anonymity.</p>
                    <p>“Whilst a toolkit could help provide some consistent and improved standards across coverage, there remains the risk that this may not be universally adhered to (ibid.).” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>“Anything to help a victims family, but this may have no teeth and could see the same issues arising again and again” – individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p>One respondent suggested that it would be important to ensure that a toolkit did not only apply to traditional forms of media but also to online outlets and social media. Another suggested that a toolkit could have a positive influence on social media users.</p>
                    <p>The concerns noted above were also shared with many of those respondents that answered neutrally or did not answer the question but provided some additional comments.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents noted that a media toolkit might only have a positive impact on those who already report sensitively, and have no impact on those who do not.</p>
                    <p>“A media toolkit might be of assistance to ethical journalists and publishers who are concerned about boundaries. It seems unlikely, however, that it would make any difference to the conduct of unethical journalists in pursuit of “a scoop” or to those individuals who post on social media without any regard for the feelings of others.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>“While certainly worthy of discussion, the parameters of such a toolkit would likely mirror the regulation and self-regulation already in use by responsible media companies. Any less responsible publishing activity would likely ignore the toolkit anyway.” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>Many responses from media organisations reiterated that they would require more information on the “content, authorship and status” of a media toolkit before they could give a view on it.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that did not support a media toolkit, in addition to enforceability, reasons included it would take too long to develop and it is not the place of the government to tell the media how to operate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Question 8: What should such a toolkit cover?</strong></p>
                    <p>27 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Other respondents addressed this issue in comments made throughout their response.</p>
                    <p>There were key recurring themes in respect of the overall principles a media toolkit should cover. These were: it should be “victim-centred” and “trauma-informed” and should emphasise empathy, dignity, the privacy of those bereaved and the importance of factual reporting.</p>
                    <p>More specific suggestions of what should be covered in a toolkit, and how the overall principles/standards could be achieved, included guidance on:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>the language used – it should not be inflammatory or sensationalist</li>
                     <li>the traumatic impact coverage can have on those who have been bereaved - this could include sharing people’s lived experience</li>
                     <li>limiting the detail included – only necessary information should be covered</li>
                     <li>how photos are included, including the importance of consulting the family on preferred photo choice and respecting that decision, not taking photos without permission from social media, and avoiding having victim/perpetrator photos side by side</li>
                     <li>avoidance of the repetition of coverage at later dates, for example on anniversaries, or birthdays</li>
                     <li>including content/trigger warnings for potentially distressing content</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>One respondent referred to <a href="https://www.unicef.org/eca/media/ethical-guidelines">UNICEF’s Guidelines for journalists reporting on children</a> as a helpful example.</p>
                    <p>As covered elsewhere in this report, respondents were also asked to what extent they supported “No anonymity restrictions (i.e. the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit” and to what extent they thought this option was proportionate and enforceable. Further detail can be found at pages 19-20 and 51 respectively.</p>
                    <h3>Other non-legislative options</h3>
                    <p><strong>Question 9: Are there other non-legislative means of improving how child homicides are reported and information published?</strong></p>
                    <p>27 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p>Suggestions of other non-legislative means of improving how child homicides are reported on and information published included:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>a separate toolkit for those who have been bereaved to support them in navigating the media interest in, and coverage of, the case and provide information on their rights</li>
                     <li>publicising the impact media coverage can have on those who have been bereaved with the sharing of lived experience:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>“It would be worth continuing to publicise the negative impact of publicity and of particular kinds of reporting on the families of children who have been homicide victims. At least then those who report such things, whether as journalists or on social media, would be reminded of the harm they may do and, it is to be hoped, reassess what they were tempted to write originally.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>more proactive and joint communication between justice agencies and families about what the media might report</li>
                     <li>specialist media training on trauma-informed reporting</li>
                     <li>strengthening the current system of press self-regulation</li>
                     <li>improving the relationship between media and justice agencies:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>“Improving relationships between journalists and legal officers – including the police, court officials and judges – would be a first step to improve the quality of reporting and protect the principles of open justice. In turn, this would support families of victims and communities directly affected by the trauma of bereavement.” – Independent Press Standards Organisation</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>inclusion of additional clauses on how child homicides are reported in the <abbr title="Independent Press Standards Organisation">IPSO</abbr> Editor’s Code of Practice and National Union of Journalists Code of Conduct</li>
                     <li>more robust tests to evaluate what is in the public interest</li>
                     <li>collaboration between those affected by child homicide and those reporting it</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Of the 28 respondents that provided an answer to this question, a majority (18) either agreed or strongly agreed, 5 neither agreed or disagreed and 5 either disagreed or strongly disagreed that the Scottish Government should work with the criminal justice agencies to explore non-legislative options to help reduce the trauma of reporting on bereaved families of child homicide victims.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that agreed that the Scottish Government should work with the criminal justice agencies to explore non-legislative options, some noted the benefits of collaborative working and bringing agencies together, that all options should be explored, and that this should be happening currently.</p>
                    <p>“We have heard from families bereaved by crime that they would also welcome greater, proactive communication between justice agencies and families about what the media might report (ibid.). Measures should be taken to ensure that sensitive information is reaching families directly, before it is announced in the media. Additionally, families should be proactively made aware of their rights surrounding media reporting.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>“It is always better to gain agreement and work with professions in a consensual, collaborative way, legislative options should be a last resort where voluntary agreements have failed to produce a desired outcome… As well as trying to reduce the impact of reporting, full support should be given to families to help them cope at a very difficult time including support from police, victim support, social work and associated services. This will require investment in services to ensure they have both time and appropriate training to effectively support families bereaved through homicide.” - Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>Some victim support organisations suggested that as an official source of information for the media, criminal justice agencies – including Police Scotland, the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service – have a duty to ensure that only necessary information is released, that it is accurate, that it has been released with regard to the impact it may have on the bereaved family and has been shared with them first. Further suggestions included that official press releases could include guidance on respecting the family’s privacy.</p>
                    <p>Some media organisation respondents commented that the matter is “for the Scottish Government and the criminal justice agencies.”</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that disagreed that the Scottish Government should work with the criminal justice agencies to explore non-legislative options, some commented that this was not the role of government, with one individual stating that it would be “a very undemocratic move.”</p>
                    <p>“We do not believe it is for government and the legal system to produce restrictions, statutory or otherwise, which will inevitably impact on freedom of expression or force change on existing non-statutory systems set up to ensure its defence There would be a high risk that rejection of government proposals would result in the introduction of statutory controls.” – Newsbrands Scotland</p>

                    <p>Of the 25 respondents that provided an answer to this question, 12 selected ‘from the point of a child’s death (when it is established criminality is involved)’, 1 selected ‘from the start of criminal proceedings’ and the remaining 12 selected ‘other’.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that selected from the point of a child’s death (when it is established that criminality is involved), reasons given included: any later would be too late as information may already have been released and once details are in the public domain it is difficult/impossible to remove them, and this option would provide protection and choice/control for those bereaved from the earliest point when they are at their most vulnerable.</p>
                    <p>“Reporting restrictions should apply from the earliest possible point and to as wide a jurisdiction as possible (i.e. <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> wide and include online and social media content). Whilst inevitably there will be widespread knowledge about the fact that a child has died because of homicide, that information being available worldwide, in the public domain, often with graphic levels of detail about the circumstances involved and being difficult if not impossible to completely retract is the key difference. - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>“This will protect the families surviving siblings and the victim from the very beginning this is when it it is very difficult and the media are relentless at the beginning it will give families time to process what's happened and peace also and they also won't find things out in the media before having the chance to be told by the people who it should be” - individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p>Other respondents suggested that they favoured anonymity starting from the point of a child’s death, regardless of if criminality has been established.</p>
                    <p>“It is <abbr title="Scottish Association of Social Workers">SASW</abbr>s view that anonymity should be offered to families at the point of a child's death regardless of criminality, with families having the option to waive this without the need to go to court. Bereaved families should not be expected to go to court either to secure anonymity or to waive this. In complex cases there can be a long investigative period between a child's death and the start of criminal proceedings during which time the family can find themselves subject to intense scrutiny and public speculation. An assumption of anonymity would enable families to grieve in private unless they decided to share details of their loss. Where it was considered anonymity would hamper any police investigation or unduly impact freedom of expression application could be made to court to lift anonymity, as currently is the case with child offenders and rape victims.” - Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>Some respondents commented that this should not be the start point for anonymity as there could be a need to notify the local community and to identify witnesses.</p>
                    <p>“it is within our experience that there can be considerable investigative benefit in publicity which prompts members of the public to come forward with what may be vitally important evidence. This may suggest that it should not start from the point of death.</p>
                    <p>Very few child deaths will be invisible to the immediately surrounding community. If a child is suddenly absent from school, there may be alarm and suspicion directed to the child’s family which may be dispelled by the publication of information about the child’s death.” – Senators of the College of Justice</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that selected ‘other’, the main reason given, primarily from media organisations, was that they did not think anonymity should be introduced at any point.</p>

                    <p>25 respondents answered this question, 3 of those answered ‘Family members must apply to court to waive anonymity’ and 9 answered ‘Family members are allowed to waive anonymity without requiring a court order but restrictions do not fall when they do so and those wishing to publish identifying information must seek permission from the family before doing so’. The further 13 all answered ‘other’.</p>
                    <p>Those who supported the option of family members needing to apply to court to waive anonymity told us: there is the need for an independent monitor of the waiver process particularly as families may not be in agreement about waiving anonymity; although there would be a cost issue associated with applying for a waiver, this could be addressed by the provision of legal aid; and although it may be a difficult process for the families to engage with, it would provide necessary protection for them.</p>
                    <p>However, other respondents raised concerns about family members having to go through a court process at a time when they are already under great emotional strain.</p>
                    <p>No respondents that answered this question supported family members being allowed to waive anonymity without requiring a court order, resulting in all restrictions falling. One respondent commented that allowing anonymity to be waived without going to court would risk families waiving anonymity without having a full understanding of the potential implications.</p>
                    <p>Many of those that supported family members being allowed to waive anonymity without a court order but restrictions remaining in place, with those who wish to publish identifying information being required to seek permission from the family, commented that this would be the best way to give the families choice and control.</p>
                    <p>“I think this gives parents or next of kin the power they should have to make these choices . It is their child or family member. They have some control . At a time when there [sic] life is out of control. Court could be involved if one guardian disagrees. However again better to take time to make these decisions under anonymity as other way round there is no coming back.” - individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p>Some respondents commented that the benefit of this option was it would allow family members to, for example, post about their child on social media or fundraise in their name without having to go through a potentially costly and time consuming court process.</p>
                    <p>Other respondents raised concerns about this option including: the family may be inundated with requests to publish information and may feel pressured to do so, and a lack of clarity on if this would allow family members to identify the child on mainstream media.</p>
                    <p>“A waiver that can be granted without a judicial process leaves vulnerable families open to inadvertently granting a waiver they did not wish to grant. For example, the press may interpret social media posts by the family as a form of waiver since information about the deceased may be considered to have entered the public domain (even if this information is obviously private, such as details of the funeral arrangements). This would have the effect of limiting the right of the family to their own freedom of expression, which may be an important” - Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised complications with, and concerns about, a waiver in general including: defining who is a family member for the purposes of waiving anonymity would be challenging due to the complexities of modern families. For example, where the perpetrator is a family member would they have a say on waiving anonymity? Family members may also have differing views and disagree about identifying the child.</p>
                    <p>“Many Scots live in a network of complex and flexible relationships- there are blended families, care-experienced children and children whose grandparents play the major role in their upbringing. Even in the most “traditional” families, there may be conflicting narratives and differences in attitudes to publicity. Indeed, where a child has died at the hands of one person in loco parentis, it is more likely than not that other parents and their extended family will have strong views on the matter. There will need at some point to be a focus on definitions of who the family are, what constitutes identifying information and what is to be done in the event of family disagreement.” - Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>As stated above, 13 respondents selected ‘other’ in response to the question about how a waiver should operate. Many of these respondents commented that they did not believe that anonymity should be introduced at all.</p>
                    <p>Some victim support organisations selected ‘other’ to propose an additional approach. They highlighted that although there was a lack of consensus on how a waiver should operate among the families bereaved by crime that they had consulted with, the organisations had concerns about a waiver process that did not have judicial oversight. They did, however, note that engaging with court processes could also be retraumatising for family members so suggested that the onus of applying for the waiver could rest with the media. They further raised that a waiver process would give families the time necessary to consider what is best for them:</p>
                    <p>“Families often tell us they feel exploited in their time of grief to divulge intimate details to satiate response to the press and public desire for true crime content – something that they often later regret. The public’s appetite for information cannot outweigh a family’s (ibid.). Ensuring child homicide victim’s anonymity would help provide space for families to grieve in private and process information at their own pace (ibid.).” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>Some respondents were of the view that, in the case that a family has waived anonymity, the process of seeking permission to publish identifying information should be done via the court system rather than by seeking permission from the family directly as:</p>
                    <p>“Placing responsibility on family members to permit publishing of identifying information may impose an undue administrative burden on them at a time of grieving, and may lead to inconsistencies in decision making. The family having waived anonymity can be used by the court to inform their decision to waive anonymity more widely, the court is likely to take a more objective stance and it places the burden of court process on publishing organisations rather than private individuals… A court process for journalists to gain a waiver for anonymity would ensure families were both informed and had the opportunity to have their views represented and considered.” - Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p><strong>Question 13: Who should be allowed to waive anonymity/apply for a waiver?</strong></p>
                    <p>29 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents, particularly individuals who had been bereaved, suggested parents, next of kin, main guardians or immediate family members should be allowed to waive anonymity.</p>
                    <p>Again, many respondents commented on the difficulties in defining family members, even parents/guardians, for these purposes and the difficulties presented when they do not share a unified view.</p>
                    <p>“Family structures are complicated. It is not uncommon for a parent to be absent for a short or long period, for a grandparent to be involved, or for a wider group of family to be involved in responsibility for the child than the immediate parents. There is currently no mechanism to define who has a right to make that decision, or for a speedy way to resolve differences if the parents or guardian’s opinions vary.” – National Union of Journalists</p>
                    <p>Due to these complexities, and the low number of child homicide cases some respondents from victim support organisations suggested the question of who had the right to waive anonymity could be taken on a case-by case basis and carefully considered by the court “so that risks and competing interests can be appropriately managed.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>However, others did not think a court process would necessarily be a simple solution to this:</p>
                    <p>“Whilst a court could endeavour to evaluate and adjudicate between competing views, such a mechanism would be a cumbersome, expensive and potentially traumatising process for the bereaved.” – Senators of the College of Justice</p>
                    <p>“The most inclusive approach would be to require application to the court before anonymity could be waived (Question 12, option (a)) and permitting only certain, defined relatives of the child to make such an application but requiring them to notify certain other relatives who would have the opportunity to oppose the application. Of course, each group of relatives would have to be defined. On reflection, while this approach has the advantage of inclusivity, the time it would take to complete the necessary steps and the potential cost involved suggests that it is just too cumbersome.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <h3>Potential impact of anonymity for child homicide victims</h3>
                    <h4>Bereaved talking about loss</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 3: To what extent do you think an extension of anonymity to deceased child victims would affect family and friends wanting to talk publicly about their loss?</strong></p>
                    <p>29 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Other respondents addressed this issue in comments made throughout their response.</p>
                    <p>It was commonly raised by respondents, across all categories, that not all of those who have been bereaved will respond in the same way, their experience of grief and trauma is unique as will be how they process their experience. Therefore if, and how, they wish to talk publicly about their loss will also be unique.</p>
                    <p>There was broad agreement among respondents that there are many reasons individuals may wish to talk publicly including: as part of their grieving process, to raise awareness, campaign for change, fundraise, and to memorialise and celebrate the life of their loved one.</p>
                    <p>Many respondents also commented on the wide range of people who are impacted by such a loss and may wish to talk about it publicly including: family members, friends, neighbours, teachers, members of the local community, and professionals such as doctors, lawyers and academics.</p>
                    <p>“Experience tells us that family reactions to being bereaved of their children by homicide is diverse, from people reluctant to engage with the media at all, to survivors wanting to publicly celebrate the life of their loved one, using their platform to push for legal and policy change, for accountability for the failures of public authorities, and even just to memorialise the complexity of their loved one’s life, achievements and passions, resisting the sometimes powerful tendency to reduce the person to their victim status and their cause of death. Indeed, a longstanding critique of our media culture has been that it places outsize emphasis on the character and biography of perpetrators, paying insufficient attention to the lives, characters and contributions of their victims. Affording relatives the chance to speak out in public is often regarded as an important corrective to these reductive social impulses… There is no uniform victim experience, and creating a one-size fits all solution is likely to lead to bad law.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>“The experience of many journalists is that, even in what can be the darkest hour, most people (including victims) wish to share and inform.” – Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised concerns about the negative impact on friends and family if a strict approach to anonymity was introduced for child victims of homicide with many, particularly media organisations, suggesting this would breach the right to freedom of expression of those individuals (covered in more detail in the specific section on freedom of expression below). Concerns were also raised about the risk and proportionality of criminalising grieving family and friends if they were to share information about the victim (covered in more detail in the specific section on enforcement of anonymity and social media below).</p>
                    <p>The negative experience of those bereaved in other jurisdictions where anonymity provisions have been introduced, particularly the Republic of Ireland and Victoria, Australia, was commonly raised by respondents, with the <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/-/media/files/committees/education-children-and-young-people-committee/correspondence/2024/anonymity-for-deceased-child-victims--paper-on-international-examples.pdf">research</a> undertaken by the Scottish Government on international models of anonymity for deceased victims of crimes often being referred to. Respondents to this consultation suggested lessons should be learned from these jurisdictions.</p>
                    <p>Further comments included that family and friends would have to anonymise themselves due to the risk of jigsaw identification with some, particularly media organisations, suggesting this could impact them negatively.</p>
                    <p>“By definition, it would entirely prevent families and friends from talking publicly about their loss, whether via a news publisher or themselves on social media, for example. Moreover, unless the family and friends effectively also anonymise themselves, there is likely to be a significant risk of jigsaw identification… Importantly, it would be entirely disproportionate for such good faith activities to result in the criminal conviction of family and friends… Not only would it detrimentally impact their freedom of expression, but it would discourage them from expressing themselves from fear of prosecution.” - <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>However other respondents, particularly victim support organisations, did not share these concerns as they thought it would be possible for those bereaved to share their stories without identifying themselves or the victim, and referred to examples of anonymised interviews and media engagement. Some, more commonly victim support organisations and individuals who had been bereaved, often raised that the introduction of anonymity with the option for it to be waived would have a positive impact for those bereaved as it would give them choice and control in how they engaged with the media.</p>
                    <p>However, some respondents were of the view that even if there was a process to waive anonymity this could still have unintended consequences, further complications and a negative impact on those bereaved. For example, family members and friends will likely have differing views on speaking publicly, particularly given the complexities of modern families, and the views of individuals can change over time. This is covered in more detail in the section above on waivers.</p>
                    <h4>Police investigation</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 4: Do you consider that an extension to anonymity would have an impact on the ability of the police to investigate a crime? Please provide details.</strong></p>
                    <p>30 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Other respondents addressed this issue in comments made throughout their response.</p>
                    <p>Many respondents across all categories recognised the importance of the police being able to fully investigate crimes.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that were of the view that an extension of anonymity would have a detrimental impact on the ability of the police to investigate a crime, the majority were media organisations. It was commonly raised in these responses that the media can play an important role in assisting with police investigations as their coverage of crimes can raise public awareness of an investigation and bring forward witnesses who may not have otherwise realised they held important information. It was also suggested that without the name of the victim, any media coverage may be less effective and the audience are likely to be less engaged.</p>
                    <p>“An anonymity extension would have a significant impact on the ability of the police to implement an effective media strategy to appeal for information and witnesses in order to help identify and bring to justice a perpetrator if media organisations cannot publish the victim’s name, picture or any meaningful detail about the case or circumstances if there is a risk that that detail might lead to identification. There is a real risk that this lack of context and information may mean that members of the public who possess information of significance to the investigation may not even know this information is in their possession.</p>
                    <p>The police often work with families to publicise crimes in the pursuit of justice. Anonymity would significantly impact the amount of media coverage given to a case - and the effectiveness of that coverage. The media would be diminished as a powerful tool in such cases.</p>
                    <p>… An anonymity extension is likely to diminish the number of people who will listen or take interest in a police appeal for information relating to an anonymous victim. Not through a lack of compassion but through unknowingly having been deprived of context, connection, commentary, and responsible media analysis. ” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>Some respondents referred to situations that start as a missing child case, with widespread publicity to aid the search, but then develop into homicide cases, and suggested that introducing reporting restrictions at that point could then impede the police in gathering further information from potential witnesses.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents, particularly individuals who had been bereaved, did not believe an extension of anonymity to child homicide victims would impact on the ability of the police to investigate and referred to examples of anonymity in other types of case or for other individuals, for example where the accused is a child or for child victims of sexual offences.</p>
                    <p>Other respondents suggested that there are things that could be done to ensure that any extension of anonymity does not interfere with the ability of the police to investigate such as providing an exemption to restrictions for this purpose. When considering if information should be released, some respondents suggested that a balance must be struck between the potential benefit to the investigation and the potential harm to those bereaved and that the police are already adept at dealing with these sensitive decisions in other types of cases.</p>
                    <p>“Ensuring that police can continue to fulfil their functions is crucial, but we do not believe the proposed changes would impact on this. There are existing arrangements for example in respect of missing person cases that can be built upon, as well as existing guidelines and processes for Police Scotland liaising with families to agree communication strategies, as well as Police Scotland working with <abbr title="Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service">COPFS</abbr> regarding the publication of information in criminal investigations. Whilst there may be risks, for example that a child identified previously as a missing person would be identified should the case develop into a homicide investigation, these risks exist currently for example where a missing person case develops into a criminal investigation where that individual is now a victim. These risks would appear to be unavoidable.” - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>Some victim support organisations specifically raised missing person cases, where the name of a child might be shared while they are missing but when they are found alive, the name has then been retrospectively redacted from media coverage due to criminality involving sexual offences:</p>
                    <p>“We believe the same approach can and should apply in cases where the child dies as a result of crime, regardless of whether or not there is a sexual element. This also demonstrates the ability to limit the widespread identification of the victim and their family by the general public outside of the local community.</p>
                    <p>It is important to highlight that the identity of children who are victims of a sexual crimes are protected and it is not considered that this impedes police investigations. Further, media outlets do not report on sexual crimes where incest is involved. We believe that if the Police can successfully investigate sexual crimes while protecting anonymity, the same can be done for child homicide cases.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>Some respondents did not offer a direct view on this issue as they thought the Police were best placed to answer this.</p>
                    <h4>Freedom of expression</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 5: Do you consider that an extension to anonymity would have an impact on freedom of expression? Please provide details.</strong></p>
                    <p>29 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Other respondents addressed this issue in comments made throughout their response.</p>
                    <p>The impact an extension of anonymity would have on freedom of expression was a significant concern for all media organisation respondents with some warning that it could be legally challengeable as non-compliant with Articles 8 (right to respect for private and family life) and 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘<abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>’).</p>
                    <p>Other respondents expressed concerns specifically about the impact if anonymity was introduced with no option to waive.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, some respondents, primarily those who had been bereaved, indicated they did not think there would be an impact on freedom of expression and stressed the importance of protecting the family.</p>
                    <p>Many respondents raised that an extension of anonymity would not only restrict the freedom of expression of the media but would also directly impact individuals, including those that had been bereaved, from talking publicly about their loss (covered in more detail in the section above on bereaved talking about loss).</p>
                    <p>“It is a fundamental error in thinking about and stress-testing proposals in this area to think that free expression is primarily or exclusively the preserve of a sometimes intrusive media. Reporting restrictions affect not only broadcasters and national publishers, but also ordinary people, including bereaved families and friends.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>Although the majority of respondents that addressed this issue stated that an extension of anonymity would have an impact on freedom of expression, many noted that this is a qualified right and that restrictions to it can be justified in some circumstances.</p>
                    <p>“it is important to remember, that the right to freedom of expression, as provided for in the European Convention on Human Rights (<abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>) and the Human Rights Act 1998, is not unqualified. As the <abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>, Art.10(2) makes clear, lawful and proportionate encroachment on the right is permissible in certain limited circumstances and those that are particularly applicable here are the prevention of (another) crime and public safety. As is discussed in the Consultation Paper, freedom of expression is already curtailed in other contexts. Thus, while freedom of expression would be impacted by the reforms under discussion, that is no reason to rule them out.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>The need to balance competing rights, particularly freedom of expression and privacy, in order to determine if an encroachment on them is appropriate was commonly raised. Many respondents raised that to be justified, an intrusion on freedom of expression must be proportionate, with any restriction of the right being the least intrusive possible, and should only be introduced to prevent worse harms.</p>
                    <p>“There is a balancing exercise to be struck between protecting the vulnerable, especially other children who are caught up in these tragedies, and ensuring that the media can play its essential role by reporting on matters of public interest. Responsibility for deciding how to strike this balance is ultimately a matter for the Scottish Government, but it is clear that the proposed extension would represent a very significant change to the existing position, with uncertain impacts. Preventing the publication of material identifying the victim would seriously constrain reporting and the freedom of family members and the wider community to communicate with each other about what happened for an indeterminate amount of time.” – Independent Press Standards Organisation</p>
                    <p>“It is our position that it is not a robust response to legislate where the statistical basis for intervention remains so small (even although the subject matter may be heart rending) when contrasted against the significantly increased restriction on freedom of expression envisaged by such change.” – Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>Some media organisations also raised in their responses that an extension of anonymity could cause media outlets to “err on the side of caution” in their reporting of such cases and would therefore have a “chilling effect” on the media.</p>
                    <p>However, other respondents raised that anonymity of deceased child victims would only prevent the name of the child being covered and would not prevent general reporting of the case so would not meaningfully limit the media’s freedom of expression. Some noted that this already successfully happens for victims of sexual offences.</p>
                    <p>“Anonymity is extended in other legal arenas such as to victims of rape due to the impact on victims and their families. Children who have been murdered and their families are likewise victims. Restrictions on freedom of expression can be justified in the face of potential harm to others, but should be carefully balanced decision taken by skilled and experienced professionals. In our view, this is not a simple tick list decision however. It requires skilled and experienced risk assessment as to the risks of harm and thoughtful liaison with the families of the victim.” – Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>“The media would still be able to report on cases of child homicide, just not identify the victim. This allows the public interest to be served whilst maintaining the privacy and dignity of the victim and their family. The media already anonymously reports on sexual crimes (<abbr title="Independent Press Standards Organisation">IPSO</abbr>, 2021), which is evidence that this practice can be extended to child homicide cases.</p>
                    <p>… Media representatives warn of the ‘chilling effect’ this measure may have on reporting. We do not accept this assertion. We firmly believe it is still possible to report on child homicide cases while ensuring the anonymity of the victim.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <h4>Whose rights are being protected</h4>
                    <p>Some respondents raised the importance of being clear on whose rights are being protected when considering the extension of anonymity to child victims of homicide and which are the priority: those of the deceased child, surviving child siblings, other family members, the general public or the media.</p>
                    <p>“Rights and principles like freedom of expression, privacy, public interest and open justice will always require to be balanced in decision making. Like most decisions regarding reporting restrictions there are balances to be struck, often balances that are highly case specific. We need to consider whose freedom of expression and privacy is the priority here - that of the deceased victim, their next of kin and surviving relatives, or of those who are publicly identifying the child, including media outlets? We also need to consider the differing motivations for such expression and that these motivations may change. Within these considerations, the contested concept of public interest is important” - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>Many respondents throughout their response referred to the protection of fundamental rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (<abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (<abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child">UNCRC</abbr>), with a range of views on whose rights should be protected and prioritised. Some also referred to the Scottish Government’s commitment to ‘<a href="https://www.gov.scot/policies/girfec/">getting it right for every child</a>’ (<abbr title="Getting it Right for Every Child">GIRFEC</abbr>).</p>
                    <p>Comparisons were made by many respondents with the rights and protections for a child perpetrator and those, or lack of, for a deceased child victim. It was often suggested, particularly by individuals who had been bereaved, that upon death the child victim loses rights, and comparisons were also drawn with the anonymity of surviving victims of sexual abuse.</p>
                    <p>“I believe that victims under the age of 18 who die as a result of crime should be given the same rights and protections as a living victim under the age of 18 who is the victim of another crime, for example sexual abuse or assault.</p>
                    <p>… The current legislation in Scotland gives anonymity to perpetrators in Scotland who are under the age of 18, we are not asking too much. Why should victims not be given the same right when they are killed as a result of a crime?” – individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p>“However I believe there should be a law protecting the confidentiality of the child victim. The poor child deserves to still have rights especially as the right to live has been taken away from them. Not giving them this dignity as we would in life means we are saying they don't matter anymore. You can understand why its hard for victims families to witness how many rights the perpetrator has. No one protects the victim and in turn the family.” - individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p>“Where there is a crime with a sexual element and the child also dies as a result of that crime, then the child loses their right to anonymity. This results in details of a crime being made available that would not have been disclosed if the child had survived. Families tell us this feels particularly dehumanising and disrespectful (Victim Support Scotland, 2024b).</p>
                    <p>… We are opposed to child victims losing rights they would otherwise have because they are a victim of homicide.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>However, one respondent disagreed with the view that child homicide victims lose rights to anonymity on death, as the statutory restrictions currently available to victims of other crimes (including orders under section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and section 27 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995) are discretionary and do not automatically apply to all children in all circumstances.</p>
                    <p>“For this reason, it is not a correct statement of the current law that child victims lose anonymity rights enjoyed by other children involved in the criminal justice process. As currently framed, the 1995 Act currently only protects some children from publicity in connection with criminal cases, and then only from traditional broadcasters and publications.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>Other respondents, mainly from media organisations, suggested that the rights under discussion, particularly privacy, do not continue after death:</p>
                    <p>“If this is analysed as being a right owed to the dignity of the victim, that would be a startling change to the Scottish legal system’s approach to the consequences of death… It is a general legal principle that an individual’s privacy and reputational rights fall away upon death and are not transferable to others.” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>One respondent went on to explain that although the privacy rights of the deceased are not protected, European case law indicates that the rights of surviving family members are:</p>
                    <p>“…it is not the deceased’s right to privacy which is therefore protected, but how the reputation of the deceased member impacts on the private life of surviving family members, which can include siblings… While it remains the case that it is not the deceased person who is centred in the case, but the rights of their surviving relatives, it does seem that there has been a shift towards more extensive protection in recent case law which should factor into the analysis of this proposal in human rights terms.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>Many respondents referred to the rights of the surviving family, particularly child siblings, to have a private, family life. The impact of media coverage on surviving child siblings more generally is covered above at page 12.</p>
                    <p>The rights of surviving children was discussed in detail particularly in responses from children’s organisations and victims support organisations. Key points raised were:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>“The rights and views of surviving siblings should be paramount in decisions.” – Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</li>
                     <li>although there is a balancing of rights to freedom of expression and privacy for all surviving family members, regardless of age, the right to privacy of a child is likely to be stronger due to their inherent vulnerability</li>
                     <li>children also have additional rights and protections under the <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child">UNCRC</abbr>:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>“The <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child">UNCRC</abbr>, in Article 37, provides an obligation on the State to “take all appropriate measures to promote the physical and psychological recovery…” of child victims. Surviving siblings should be regarded as secondary victims” – Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland</p>
                    <p>However, some respondents did not think that the age of the bereaved should be the main indicator of the need for anonymity and that a more nuanced approach would be necessary:</p>
                    <p>“It may be more appropriate to use the circumstances of the loss, rather than age of siblings, to inform whether anonymity is appropriate in a particular instances. Age of children is not the defining indicator of their capacity to understand. More important is the support they have from their parents, other caregivers, schools and peer group. Withholding information from children due to perceptions of age can cause long term harm, affecting relationships in the years to come. Children need honest information that they can trust, digest and emotionally process. Parents and siblings should get the professional support they need to navigate this very difficult stage within their loss and grief.” – Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>One respondent noted that there could be implications for children’s rights more generally and these must be taken into consideration:</p>
                    <p>“The implications for children, including surviving siblings, but also other children who may be involved in a child’s death, including witnesses, other non-deceased victims, and any child suspect/accused, need to be fully considered. A child rights and wellbeing impact assessment will be required.” – Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <h4>Open justice</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 6: Do you consider that an extension to anonymity would have an impact on open justice? Please provide details</strong></p>
                    <p>29 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Other respondents addressed this issue in comments made throughout their response.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that thought an extension to anonymity would have a significant negative impact on open justice,<a href="jxxxxxx-xx.htm"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the majority were media organisations. Terms commonly used to show the strength of feeling on this included: “a serious restriction to”, “a major encroachment on”, “antithetical to” and “detrimental to” the principle of open justice:</p>
                    <p>“For journalists and the public, anonymity is probably the most intrusive of all restrictions. To anonymise the dead victim of an indictable crime of the utmost gravity would, substantially, eviscerate open justice. Leaving aside the very large overlap between familial relationship and criminal guilt in child homicide cases, permanently to conceal the identity of any victim of unlawful killing is starkly antithetical to open justice.” - <abbr>DC</abbr> Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd</p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised that as the perpetrators of child homicides are most commonly parents, in these cases the perpetrator would also have to be afforded anonymity due to the risk of jigsaw identification. This was seen to compound the impact anonymity for child homicide victims would have on open justice.</p>
                    <p>Others offered explanation as to what they understood open justice to mean and the role the media play in it.</p>
                    <p>“For most people, open justice means understanding a court case and its outcomes. The platform for doing this is media reporting. Media reporting is based on telling human stories that connect with audiences. Anonymity in such important cases will significantly restrict the level and quality of reporting and reduce the amount of people who know about a case and how justice was served.</p>
                    <p>Transparency and reporting of criminal cases is key to ensure that perpetrators and those involved in enforcing the law are held to account. This is vital to improve public confidence in the justice system.” - <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>“Generally, the work of the courts must be accessible to the public. Very few members of the public are in a position to attend at a court to observe proceedings and, whilst sentencing statements and judgments are published on <abbr title="Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service">SCTS</abbr> websites, the principal conduit of information about court cases is the media.” – Senators of the College of Justice</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that thought an extension to anonymity would not impact on open justice, it was often raised that anonymity would not prevent the cases from being reported on. Some respondents also referred to examples of anonymity for other individuals and case types including where the accused is under 18 and also victims of sexual offences.</p>
                    <p>“We do not believe that these changes will fundamentally impact on open justice. Justice will still be seen to be served and cases will still be able to be reported on, just without information that identifies the child and therefore in a manner that affords greater protection to deceased children and their families.</p>
                    <p>We recognise the challenges of jigsaw identification and that these changes could inevitably mean parents who murder their child are not identified. However, this could be beneficial to any other surviving siblings, avoiding the potential stigma these children could experience. There will also be learning from approaches in other cases involving child victims where offences are committed by a family member who benefit from reporting restrictions for example cases of incest.” – Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>“The Consultation Paper refers to open justice requiring court proceedings to be open to the public and transparency in reporting on criminal cases and these are important aspects of it. However, that does not mean that the public is – or needs to be – entitled to know about every aspect of every case. In short, a distinction can be drawn between there being a “public interest” is having certain information and (the more prurient members of) the public simply “being interested”.</p>
                    <p>… The sort of restrictions under discussion would prevent naming deceased child victims, publishing photographs of them or reporting information that might reasonably lead to their identification. These restrictions would not prevent reporting of the fact that the crime had been committed, the essence of it (nature of the crime, geographic location, details of suspects and so forth), the police investigation or legal proceedings relating to it.” - individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>Other respondents noted that, like freedom of expression, constraints and restrictions to open justice can be justified and referred to factors to be taken in to consideration including harm to family members and the public interest (covered in more detail below).</p>
                    <p>“It is important to acknowledge that open justice is not without constraints and restrictions… The media are accustomed to operating within court-imposed restrictions. If anonymity for child victims is implemented, this would be a small restriction for the press but would make coverage of the case significantly less distressing to the family and surviving siblings.” - Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <h4>Public interest</h4>
                    <p>There were no specific questions on public interest in the consultation paper. However, this was a theme that came up often in responses, particularly in relation to freedom of expression and open justice.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents, particularly media organisations, were of the view that transparent reporting on child homicide cases, including the name of the victim, is in the public interest.</p>
                    <p>“… child homicide is one of the most disturbing crimes to rend the social fabric and to engage the public interest in its public prosecution.” – Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>“To report accurately the essentials of what happens in a public court is a matter of definitive public interest, not a proprietary private right.” - <abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr> Scotland</p>
                    <p>“The truth matters. Facts prevents fake news, rumours and speculation to proliferate online uncorrected and there is a public interest in transparency when a death occurs. The death of an individual is not an entirely private matter.” – <abbr title="Independent Television News">ITN</abbr></p>
                    <p>However, other respondents raised that there is a difference between what is in the public interest and what the public are interested in, and that they are not entitled to know every detail in the name of public interest, with some victim support organisations also calling for more robust tests to evaluate what is in the public interest.</p>
                    <p>Other comments suggested that the public interest is one factor to be weighed up in considering a number of competing rights including freedom of expression, privacy and open justice and that the balance will vary case to case.</p>
                    <p>“Rights and principles like freedom of expression, privacy, public interest and open justice will always require to be balanced in decision making. Like most decisions regarding reporting restrictions there are balances to be struck, often balances that are highly case specific... Within these considerations, the contested concept of public interest is important” - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>“An extension to anonymity could have an impact on open justice, as it would restrict reporting on investigations into persons suspected of causing a child death if their identity could lead to the child being identified. This may be justifiable on occasions where the public interest is outweighed by potential harm to wider family members were the circumstances of the child death to become public knowledge. Each case will be different and require a nuanced and skilled approach to making these decision which is why we think blanket legislation is not the answer that families need.” - Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <h4>Public understanding and education</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 15: To what extent do you think it is important that the wider public understand anonymity provisions?</strong></p>
                    <p>29 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p>The majority of respondents that responded to this question thought if anonymity provisions were introduced then wider public understanding of the provisions would be of high importance, particularly as breach of the provisions would be a criminal offence resulting in a penalty.</p>
                    <p>Other respondents also highlighted that many individuals may not recognise that their own use of social media would be covered by any anonymity provisions, not just traditional forms of media, and if due to this lack of understanding they were to share prohibited information online this would risk undermining the restrictions.</p>
                    <p>“In general it is important that the wider public understand anonymity provisions however, this is a complex area of law which private individuals may not associate with their own use of social media, for example, believing that posting as a private individual to a group of friends and acquaintances does not present a breach of anonymity. If the intention is to criminalise breaches of anonymity, it is essential that the wider public have easily available, easily understood explanations of anonymity provisions.” – Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>One respondent commented that without public understanding of any extension of anonymity there would be a risk that this “could give rise to confusion and suspicion, with the perverse outcome that trust in outlets behaving responsibly – by complying with the law – could be damaged. Such misunderstanding and speculation can lay the ground for misinformation and suggestions of a “cover-up”.” – Independent Press Standards Organisation</p>
                    <p>A small number of respondents also suggested that if the public were to understand the anonymity provisions and reasons for them, this may reduce the expectation of, and demand for, extensive details in these cases.</p>
                    <p>Although many thought wider public understanding of anonymity provisions was crucial, a number of respondents suggested this would be challenging with some even stating it would be impossible.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents, mainly individuals who had been bereaved, did not think public understanding of anonymity provisions was important. This was confirmed in responses from some victim support organisations who, although they did see value in wider public understanding, reported that:</p>
                    <p>“Families bereaved by crime tell us that they do not consider that the public at large necessarily need to understand anonymity provisions. This is because families, staff and volunteers do not generally view the wider public as being responsible for the harm they have experienced (Victim Support Scotland, 2024b). Families say that the key groups who need to understand the measures are:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>The bereaved families themselves,</li>
                     <li>The media,</li>
                     <li>Victim support organisations,</li>
                     <li>Police Family Liaison Officers,</li>
                     <li>Other agencies in the criminal justice system.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Question 16: What can be done to increase public understanding of anonymity provisions?</strong></p>
                    <p>26 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p>A wide range of suggestions were received from respondents as to what can be done to increase public understanding of anonymity provisions including:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>a widespread public awareness campaign and communications strategy including leaflets and social media</li>
                     <li>bespoke information produced for those who have been bereaved, those that support them and for the media</li>
                     <li>including a statement on media articles explaining why the victim has not been named and encouraging the public not to speculate on the identity of the victim or share details on social media</li>
                     <li>sharing examples of what is permitted by law and what is not</li>
                     <li>sharing lived experience of bereaved families and the impact coverage has had on them</li>
                     <li>keeping the legislation as simple and easy to understand as possible and also consistent/aligned with other provisions relating to anonymity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>One respondent suggested this was part of the wider challenge of public legal education and suggested that much more should be done to tackle that including mandatory legal education in schools and stated that “part of the challenge here is that that (inexplicably) many members of the public do not seem to find law interesting until it affects them.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>Another respondent suggested that the money from financial penalties for breach of anonymity provisions could be used to “educate people on the harm their words cause to the victims family” – individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p><strong>Question 17: What group of people do you think it would be hardest to educate about anonymity provisions?</strong></p>
                    <p>30 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Question 18: How might this group be accessed and educated?</strong></p>
                    <p>26 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>

                    <p>One respondent stated that “While people may be grouped into categories using age, sex, gender or other personal characteristics for ease of identification or discussion, no group acts in a homogenous way. It is impossible therefore to determine which group of people might be harder to educate about anonymity provisions.” - Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <h4>Enforcement of anonymity and social media</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 22: To what extent do you think that the legislative options proposed are proportionate and enforceable? Please give reasons for your answer.</strong></p>
                    <p>Respondents were asked to what extent they thought the four options put forward in the consultation paper were proportionate and enforceable. These were:</p>
                    <p>1. No anonymity restrictions (i.e. the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit</p>
                    <p>2. Full anonymity restrictions (no waiver)</p>
                    <p>3. Automatic anonymity with option to waive</p>
                    <p>4. No automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit)</p>
                    <p>As will be shown in more detail below, the majority that responded to this question disagreed that full anonymity restrictions with no waiver (19 out of 23) and no automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (16 out of 23) are proportionate and enforceable options. Views on the proportionality of the status quo with non-legislative actions and no automatic anonymity but can apply for a court order were more mixed.</p>

                    <p>Some respondents commented that this option placed a disproportionate burden on bereaved family members at a time they are grieving.</p>
                    <p>There was a consensus in the responses from media organisations that none of the legislative options proposed were “necessary or proportionate”. Comments included:</p>
                    <p>“It is a disproportionate and impractical move, and the inevitable difficulties it would encounter and anomalies it would create could lead to even more draconian restrictions.” – Newsbrands Scotland</p>
                    <p>“thankfully the position remains that the level of child homicide remains at a very low level. It is our position that it is not a robust response to legislate where the statistical basis for intervention remains so small (even although the subject matter may be heart rending) when contrasted against the significantly increased restriction on freedom of expression envisaged by such change. – Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>“Given it will be impossible to police social media activity, in practice it will only be reputable media outlets that will be prevented from reporting and publishing information related to such cases. This may add to unfounded theories of media cover-up and will allow misinformation to go unchallenged by traditional news providers. This is dangerous and risks a significant negative social impact.</p>
                    <p>Anonymity measures will not necessarily stop certain activities raised by families bereaved by crime as a cause for concern. They will not stop people approaching family members, nor questions being asked, nor will they stop distressing posts on social platforms.” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p><strong>Question 14: What do you think are the main challenges to enforcing anonymity restrictions?</strong></p>
                    <p>30 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p>The most commonly raised theme was social media.</p>
                    <p>A large number of comments from respondents also raised a lack of public knowledge of the law and the risk of criminalising those with good intentions as challenges to enforcing anonymity restrictions</p>
                    <p>Some respondents also raised cross-border issues, this is covered in more detail below from page 57.</p>
                    <h4>Social media</h4>
                    <p>Many respondents, from across all respondent types, highlighted the difficulty in monitoring social media content and enforcing any restrictions particularly as it is not often clear or easy to establish who the “publisher” of such information is. It was often raised in responses from media organisations that it would not be appropriate to have a “two tier system” in which mainstream/traditional media was restricted but social media was not with some suggesting that the content online and on social media is often more problematic than what is covered in traditional media.</p>
                    <p>The ease and speed at which information can be circulated and shared on social media, and the difficulty in getting content removed from platforms once it has been posted, was commonly raised. Some respondents also noted that as the mainstream/traditional media outlets would be restricted they could not then correct any misinformation that may be circulated online.</p>
                    <p>“Social media has made a difference. It is very difficult to police and it is instant. Information about something that has happened locally can now be circulated whilst an incident is happening – or whilst emergency services provide a response. With or without actual reporting local knowledge of an incident, particularly a serious incident will spread. Sometimes without mainstream reporting the detail of an incident can be distorted and can become the ‘truth’ that is heard by a community. This can also be very damaging and mainstream reporting might need to be used to quash or quell the rumour mill.” - Scottish Children’s Reporter Administration</p>
                    <p>“the media would be prevented from acting as a trusted news provider as it would be unable to “set the record straight” where fake news, unsubstantiated rumours and accusations are free to spread through social media without accountability.” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>“It may also have the unintended effect of restraining responsible actors from correcting misinformation or misunderstandings” – Independent Press Standards Organisation</p>
                    <p>However some respondents, particularly victim support organisations, while recognising the challenges with social media, suggested that often the content online has stemmed from something that has been published by traditional media. They were also of the view that that the challenges with social media should not be a reason not to regulate other coverage:</p>
                    <p>“Whilst it may be tempting to view traditional media coverage and social media content as two distinct issues, families tell us that social media content that traumatises the family often originates from publications by traditional media outlets<em>… </em>it would be wrong to let the perfect be the enemy of the good and opt not to regulate press coverage just because it is deemed too difficult to regulate social media.<em>” </em>– Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>One bereaved individual suggested that content online would not be so problematic if fewer details about the crime were released in the first instance:</p>
                    <p>“Some would slip under the net but if details were instantly kept confidential they would not have much to report on regarding details. These for example cause of death, injuries ect should be sealed.” – individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <h4>Lack of public knowledge and over-criminalisation</h4>
                    <p>A large number of comments from respondents suggested that, should anonymity provisions be introduced, a lack of public knowledge of them and understanding of how they applied could be challenging for their enforcement as it could result in a great deal of information being online and on social media and therefore “any anonymity law would be more honoured in the breach”. – Newsbrands Scotland</p>
                    <p>However, other respondents suggested this could be remedied by awareness raising and education. This is covered in more detail in the section above on public understanding and education.</p>
                    <p>Linked to this, some respondents raised that many breaches of anonymity provisions are likely to be committed by those acting with good intentions, for example those who have been impacted by the loss of the child paying respects on social media and their criminalisation is not in the interests of anyone.</p>
                    <p>One respondent highlighted that anonymity provisions may have a disproportionate impact on children and young people as the dominant users of social media.</p>
                    <p>Children and young people could be disproportionately impacted by such changes as they are high users of online/social media platforms, are more likely to be peers or siblings of child homicide victims, and are still developing and going through intense physiological, emotional and cognitive change (see O'Rourke et al, 2020, literature review submitted to the Scottish Sentencing Council). The negative consequences of criminalisation are well established, and children should be protected from this as far as possible. – Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>To counter this, some respondents suggested that those who breach anonymity provisions and are acting in a professional capacity or in a position of trust should be held to a higher standard and face more serious consequences.</p>
                    <h4>Penalties</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 19: What do you think would be an appropriate penalty for breaching an anonymity restriction?</strong></p>
                    <p>28 respondents provided an answer to this question.</p>
                    <p>The most commonly suggested penalty for breaching an anonymity restriction was a fine. Some respondents suggested that this should be higher for media organisations than for individual members of the public and supported similar penalties to those proposed under the Victims, Witnesses, and Justice Reform (Scotland) Bill.<a href="jxxxxxx-xx.htm"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Further comments suggested that any financial penalty should be large enough to act as a deterrent to large media organisations who may have larger resources.</p>
                    <p>“The use of maximum penalties allows the judiciary to make decisions based on the circumstances of the case but addresses the current issues that penalties set at the current low levels may be seen as a “risk worth taking” when compared with the benefits for the individual or organisation involved, be this through sales revenue or social media/online presence.” - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>There were some suggestions from respondents as to what the money raised by fines for breaches should be used for including: used to educate people on the impact of the breach and added to the Victims Surcharge Fund to be used to support families bereaved by crime.</p>
                    <p>Other suggestions for appropriate penalties included: loss of internet use, community service, confiscation of profits from stories in breach to then be given to bereaved family, and civil recourse/ a right to sue for the bereaved family.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised concerns about the criminalisation of the general public, particularly children and those who have been bereaved, who may be well intentioned and therefore suggested that intention would be an important consideration.</p>
                    <p>“This is a complicated area. Provisions already exist in law for fines or potential imprisonment for breach of reporting restrictions. The application of this to the general public would depend of the facts of each case. As noted above, anonymity restrictions could criminalise schoolfriends paying tribute on social media. The effects of this may be as damaging as a deliberate leak by an adult aware of the legal constraints, but it may not be in the interests of justice or policing to seek to criminalise children in this way.” - National Union of Journalists</p>
                    <p>“We are concerned about the range of people who could be penalised for breaching restrictions, particularly family members who are grieving and for whom publicly sharing information about their loved ones could be an important part of the grieving process. We also recognise members of the public or community who may be impacted by the child’s death and publicly share well intentioned information could be at risk of being criminalised, underlining the importance of developing understanding of provisions. We think understanding the intent behind sharing information will be important when penalties are being considered and proportionality of response... We wonder if there could be a greater focus on penalties for organisations who breach restrictions, including social media platforms where information is shared, or penalties in terms of fines being proportionate to income/ revenue raised from the publication of such information for individuals or organisations, which could be higher than the current maximum penalties.” – Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>Other respondents did not think there should be any new restrictions and therefore there should be no penalties.</p>
                    <h4>Cross-border application</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 20: To what extent do you agree that any extension of anonymity to deceased child victims in Scotland would need to apply to the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to be effective?</strong></p>

                    <p>27 respondents answered this question, with a majority (20) stating that they ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’. 6 respondents ‘neither agreed nor disagreed’ and only one ‘strongly disagreed’.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that agreed that any extension of anonymity to deceased child victims in Scotland would need to apply to the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to be effective, the general view was that otherwise any provisions would be “unmanageable and completely ineffective” and “virtually impossible to implement and impose”.</p>
                    <p>Some media organisations commented that anonymity provisions that did not apply <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide “would create a highly fragmented approach to news reporting in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, creating confusion for families and communities and leading to bizarre scenarios where families in Scotland can talk about their grief to an English broadcaster, but not a Scottish broadcaster.” – Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>It was often raised by respondents that the proximity of the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> would mean that the identity of a victim, anonymised only in Scotland, would be easily accessible both physically in printed media and through online national media outlets which would negate the effectiveness of any reporting restrictions.</p>
                    <p>“Otherwise, a situation could arise where an English-based broadcaster could name a child homicide victim in Scottish proceedings, but a Scottish-based broadcaster could not. Without application <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide, the provisions will not achieve the desired outcomes. They would prevent trusted Scottish news publishers and broadcasters from responsible reporting, but audiences would still have full access to the story on multiple online platforms as provided by media companies based elsewhere in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>Respondents also commonly raised that news is not restricted by geographical boundaries due to the availability of news and information online through both online media outlets and social media.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents from media organisations also highlighted the operational difficulties and impracticalities that having different rules in different <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> jurisdictions would have for national media outlets:</p>
                    <p>“Further from a national news perspective it would be totally impractical producing different reports on national television and online. It does not reflect the reality of how information flows in the modern world” - <abbr title="Independent Television News">ITN</abbr></p>
                    <p>“Leaving aside the issue of the internet, the same content is often published, for example, sister titles Daily Record and The Mirror, or The Scottish Sun and The Sun. To have separate stories in separate editions is ineffective. Broadcast media does not follow the Scottish border: <abbr title="Independent Television">ITV</abbr> Border, for example, covers both. Full anonymity will be almost impossible to enforce and would be very expensive to police.” - National Union of Journalists</p>
                    <p>Some respondents noted that if the Scottish Government did want anonymity provisions to extend to the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, this would require a section 104 order under the Scotland Act and for this agreement from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Government would be crucial.</p>
                    <p>Other respondents, although of the view that extension to the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> would be necessary to be workable, commented that the effectiveness would be limited as non-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> media outlets could still publish identifying information.</p>
                    <p>However, some victim support organisations although in favour of extending any anonymity provisions <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> wide, were not of the view that restrictions in Scotland alone would be ineffective. They suggested that this would still be an improvement and could still reduce the re-traumatisation for bereaved families.</p>
                    <p>“Even if <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> media outlets do not report anonymously outwith Scotland, <abbr title="Victim Support Scotland">VSS</abbr> believes this would still improve reporting standards within Scotland, by reducing the number of triggering articles families are exposed to. Additionally, the less traction a story gets initially, as well being less geographically relevant, the less likely it is to be picked up by other news sources. Families impacted by crime often tell us that it is local media outlets that are most likely to report the story for years after the fact, on anniversaries of the death, the child’s birthday and when there is an update for the perpetrator (Victim Support Scotland, 2024b). Anonymising coverage of child homicide, even at a local level, would mitigate the situation and support the family’s wellbeing.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>Some individuals who have been bereaved and victim support organisations stated that if Scotland were to extend anonymity for child victims of homicide, other jurisdictions may then follow suit.</p>
                    <p>Another concern relating to jurisdiction was raised by some media organisations. They questioned what would determine if Scottish anonymity provisions would apply – would it be related to the location of the offence or the domicile of the victim.</p>

                    <p>Of the 25 respondents that provided an answer to this question, 12 selected ‘from the point of a child’s death (when it is established criminality is involved)’, 1 selected ‘from the start of criminal proceedings’ and the remaining 12 selected ‘other’.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that selected from the point of a child’s death (when it is established that criminality is involved), reasons given included: any later would be too late as information may already have been released and once details are in the public domain it is difficult/impossible to remove them, and this option would provide protection and choice/control for those bereaved from the earliest point when they are at their most vulnerable.</p>
                    <p>“Reporting restrictions should apply from the earliest possible point and to as wide a jurisdiction as possible (i.e. <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> wide and include online and social media content). Whilst inevitably there will be widespread knowledge about the fact that a child has died because of homicide, that information being available worldwide, in the public domain, often with graphic levels of detail about the circumstances involved and being difficult if not impossible to completely retract is the key difference. - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>“This will protect the families surviving siblings and the victim from the very beginning this is when it it is very difficult and the media are relentless at the beginning it will give families time to process what's happened and peace also and they also won't find things out in the media before having the chance to be told by the people who it should be” - individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p>Other respondents suggested that they favoured anonymity starting from the point of a child’s death, regardless of if criminality has been established.</p>
                    <p>“It is <abbr title="Scottish Association of Social Workers">SASW</abbr>s view that anonymity should be offered to families at the point of a child's death regardless of criminality, with families having the option to waive this without the need to go to court. Bereaved families should not be expected to go to court either to secure anonymity or to waive this. In complex cases there can be a long investigative period between a child's death and the start of criminal proceedings during which time the family can find themselves subject to intense scrutiny and public speculation. An assumption of anonymity would enable families to grieve in private unless they decided to share details of their loss. Where it was considered anonymity would hamper any police investigation or unduly impact freedom of expression application could be made to court to lift anonymity, as currently is the case with child offenders and rape victims.” - Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>Some respondents commented that this should not be the start point for anonymity as there could be a need to notify the local community and to identify witnesses.</p>
                    <p>“it is within our experience that there can be considerable investigative benefit in publicity which prompts members of the public to come forward with what may be vitally important evidence. This may suggest that it should not start from the point of death.</p>
                    <p>Very few child deaths will be invisible to the immediately surrounding community. If a child is suddenly absent from school, there may be alarm and suspicion directed to the child’s family which may be dispelled by the publication of information about the child’s death.” – Senators of the College of Justice</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that selected ‘other’, the main reason given, primarily from media organisations, was that they did not think anonymity should be introduced at any point.</p>

                    </table>
                    <p>25 respondents answered this question, 3 of those answered ‘Family members must apply to court to waive anonymity’ and 9 answered ‘Family members are allowed to waive anonymity without requiring a court order but restrictions do not fall when they do so and those wishing to publish identifying information must seek permission from the family before doing so’. The further 13 all answered ‘other’.</p>
                    <p>Those who supported the option of family members needing to apply to court to waive anonymity told us: there is the need for an independent monitor of the waiver process particularly as families may not be in agreement about waiving anonymity; although there would be a cost issue associated with applying for a waiver, this could be addressed by the provision of legal aid; and although it may be a difficult process for the families to engage with, it would provide necessary protection for them.</p>
                    <p>However, other respondents raised concerns about family members having to go through a court process at a time when they are already under great emotional strain.</p>
                    <p>No respondents that answered this question supported family members being allowed to waive anonymity without requiring a court order, resulting in all restrictions falling. One respondent commented that allowing anonymity to be waived without going to court would risk families waiving anonymity without having a full understanding of the potential implications.</p>
                    <p>Many of those that supported family members being allowed to waive anonymity without a court order but restrictions remaining in place, with those who wish to publish identifying information being required to seek permission from the family, commented that this would be the best way to give the families choice and control.</p>
                    <p>“I think this gives parents or next of kin the power they should have to make these choices . It is their child or family member. They have some control . At a time when there [sic] life is out of control. Court could be involved if one guardian disagrees. However again better to take time to make these decisions under anonymity as other way round there is no coming back.” - individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p>Some respondents commented that the benefit of this option was it would allow family members to, for example, post about their child on social media or fundraise in their name without having to go through a potentially costly and time consuming court process.</p>
                    <p>Other respondents raised concerns about this option including: the family may be inundated with requests to publish information and may feel pressured to do so, and a lack of clarity on if this would allow family members to identify the child on mainstream media.</p>
                    <p>“A waiver that can be granted without a judicial process leaves vulnerable families open to inadvertently granting a waiver they did not wish to grant. For example, the press may interpret social media posts by the family as a form of waiver since information about the deceased may be considered to have entered the public domain (even if this information is obviously private, such as details of the funeral arrangements). This would have the effect of limiting the right of the family to their own freedom of expression, which may be an important” - Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised complications with, and concerns about, a waiver in general including: defining who is a family member for the purposes of waiving anonymity would be challenging due to the complexities of modern families. For example, where the perpetrator is a family member would they have a say on waiving anonymity? Family members may also have differing views and disagree about identifying the child.</p>
                    <p>“Many Scots live in a network of complex and flexible relationships- there are blended families, care-experienced children and children whose grandparents play the major role in their upbringing. Even in the most “traditional” families, there may be conflicting narratives and differences in attitudes to publicity. Indeed, where a child has died at the hands of one person in loco parentis, it is more likely than not that other parents and their extended family will have strong views on the matter. There will need at some point to be a focus on definitions of who the family are, what constitutes identifying information and what is to be done in the event of family disagreement.” - Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>As stated above, 13 respondents selected ‘other’ in response to the question about how a waiver should operate. Many of these respondents commented that they did not believe that anonymity should be introduced at all.</p>
                    <p>Some victim support organisations selected ‘other’ to propose an additional approach. They highlighted that although there was a lack of consensus on how a waiver should operate among the families bereaved by crime that they had consulted with, the organisations had concerns about a waiver process that did not have judicial oversight. They did, however, note that engaging with court processes could also be retraumatising for family members so suggested that the onus of applying for the waiver could rest with the media. They further raised that a waiver process would give families the time necessary to consider what is best for them:</p>
                    <p>“Families often tell us they feel exploited in their time of grief to divulge intimate details to satiate response to the press and public desire for true crime content – something that they often later regret. The public’s appetite for information cannot outweigh a family’s (ibid.). Ensuring child homicide victim’s anonymity would help provide space for families to grieve in private and process information at their own pace (ibid.).” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>Some respondents were of the view that, in the case that a family has waived anonymity, the process of seeking permission to publish identifying information should be done via the court system rather than by seeking permission from the family directly as:</p>
                    <p>“Placing responsibility on family members to permit publishing of identifying information may impose an undue administrative burden on them at a time of grieving, and may lead to inconsistencies in decision making. The family having waived anonymity can be used by the court to inform their decision to waive anonymity more widely, the court is likely to take a more objective stance and it places the burden of court process on publishing organisations rather than private individuals… A court process for journalists to gain a waiver for anonymity would ensure families were both informed and had the opportunity to have their views represented and considered.” - Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p><strong>Question 13: Who should be allowed to waive anonymity/apply for a waiver?</strong></p>
                    <p>29 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents, particularly individuals who had been bereaved, suggested parents, next of kin, main guardians or immediate family members should be allowed to waive anonymity.</p>
                    <p>Again, many respondents commented on the difficulties in defining family members, even parents/guardians, for these purposes and the difficulties presented when they do not share a unified view.</p>
                    <p>“Family structures are complicated. It is not uncommon for a parent to be absent for a short or long period, for a grandparent to be involved, or for a wider group of family to be involved in responsibility for the child than the immediate parents. There is currently no mechanism to define who has a right to make that decision, or for a speedy way to resolve differences if the parents or guardian’s opinions vary.” – National Union of Journalists</p>
                    <p>Due to these complexities, and the low number of child homicide cases some respondents from victim support organisations suggested the question of who had the right to waive anonymity could be taken on a case-by case basis and carefully considered by the court “so that risks and competing interests can be appropriately managed.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>However, others did not think a court process would necessarily be a simple solution to this:</p>
                    <p>“Whilst a court could endeavour to evaluate and adjudicate between competing views, such a mechanism would be a cumbersome, expensive and potentially traumatising process for the bereaved.” – Senators of the College of Justice</p>
                    <p>“The most inclusive approach would be to require application to the court before anonymity could be waived (Question 12, option (a)) and permitting only certain, defined relatives of the child to make such an application but requiring them to notify certain other relatives who would have the opportunity to oppose the application. Of course, each group of relatives would have to be defined. On reflection, while this approach has the advantage of inclusivity, the time it would take to complete the necessary steps and the potential cost involved suggests that it is just too cumbersome.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <h3>Potential impact of anonymity for child homicide victims</h3>
                    <h4>Bereaved talking about loss</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 3: To what extent do you think an extension of anonymity to deceased child victims would affect family and friends wanting to talk publicly about their loss?</strong></p>
                    <p>29 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Other respondents addressed this issue in comments made throughout their response.</p>
                    <p>It was commonly raised by respondents, across all categories, that not all of those who have been bereaved will respond in the same way, their experience of grief and trauma is unique as will be how they process their experience. Therefore if, and how, they wish to talk publicly about their loss will also be unique.</p>
                    <p>There was broad agreement among respondents that there are many reasons individuals may wish to talk publicly including: as part of their grieving process, to raise awareness, campaign for change, fundraise, and to memorialise and celebrate the life of their loved one.</p>
                    <p>Many respondents also commented on the wide range of people who are impacted by such a loss and may wish to talk about it publicly including: family members, friends, neighbours, teachers, members of the local community, and professionals such as doctors, lawyers and academics.</p>
                    <p>“Experience tells us that family reactions to being bereaved of their children by homicide is diverse, from people reluctant to engage with the media at all, to survivors wanting to publicly celebrate the life of their loved one, using their platform to push for legal and policy change, for accountability for the failures of public authorities, and even just to memorialise the complexity of their loved one’s life, achievements and passions, resisting the sometimes powerful tendency to reduce the person to their victim status and their cause of death. Indeed, a longstanding critique of our media culture has been that it places outsize emphasis on the character and biography of perpetrators, paying insufficient attention to the lives, characters and contributions of their victims. Affording relatives the chance to speak out in public is often regarded as an important corrective to these reductive social impulses… There is no uniform victim experience, and creating a one-size fits all solution is likely to lead to bad law.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>“The experience of many journalists is that, even in what can be the darkest hour, most people (including victims) wish to share and inform.” – Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised concerns about the negative impact on friends and family if a strict approach to anonymity was introduced for child victims of homicide with many, particularly media organisations, suggesting this would breach the right to freedom of expression of those individuals (covered in more detail in the specific section on freedom of expression below). Concerns were also raised about the risk and proportionality of criminalising grieving family and friends if they were to share information about the victim (covered in more detail in the specific section on enforcement of anonymity and social media below).</p>
                    <p>The negative experience of those bereaved in other jurisdictions where anonymity provisions have been introduced, particularly the Republic of Ireland and Victoria, Australia, was commonly raised by respondents, with the <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/-/media/files/committees/education-children-and-young-people-committee/correspondence/2024/anonymity-for-deceased-child-victims--paper-on-international-examples.pdf">research</a> undertaken by the Scottish Government on international models of anonymity for deceased victims of crimes often being referred to. Respondents to this consultation suggested lessons should be learned from these jurisdictions.</p>
                    <p>Further comments included that family and friends would have to anonymise themselves due to the risk of jigsaw identification with some, particularly media organisations, suggesting this could impact them negatively.</p>
                    <p>“By definition, it would entirely prevent families and friends from talking publicly about their loss, whether via a news publisher or themselves on social media, for example. Moreover, unless the family and friends effectively also anonymise themselves, there is likely to be a significant risk of jigsaw identification… Importantly, it would be entirely disproportionate for such good faith activities to result in the criminal conviction of family and friends… Not only would it detrimentally impact their freedom of expression, but it would discourage them from expressing themselves from fear of prosecution.” - <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>However other respondents, particularly victim support organisations, did not share these concerns as they thought it would be possible for those bereaved to share their stories without identifying themselves or the victim, and referred to examples of anonymised interviews and media engagement. Some, more commonly victim support organisations and individuals who had been bereaved, often raised that the introduction of anonymity with the option for it to be waived would have a positive impact for those bereaved as it would give them choice and control in how they engaged with the media.</p>
                    <p>However, some respondents were of the view that even if there was a process to waive anonymity this could still have unintended consequences, further complications and a negative impact on those bereaved. For example, family members and friends will likely have differing views on speaking publicly, particularly given the complexities of modern families, and the views of individuals can change over time. This is covered in more detail in the section above on waivers.</p>
                    <h4>Police investigation</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 4: Do you consider that an extension to anonymity would have an impact on the ability of the police to investigate a crime? Please provide details.</strong></p>
                    <p>30 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Other respondents addressed this issue in comments made throughout their response.</p>
                    <p>Many respondents across all categories recognised the importance of the police being able to fully investigate crimes.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that were of the view that an extension of anonymity would have a detrimental impact on the ability of the police to investigate a crime, the majority were media organisations. It was commonly raised in these responses that the media can play an important role in assisting with police investigations as their coverage of crimes can raise public awareness of an investigation and bring forward witnesses who may not have otherwise realised they held important information. It was also suggested that without the name of the victim, any media coverage may be less effective and the audience are likely to be less engaged.</p>
                    <p>“An anonymity extension would have a significant impact on the ability of the police to implement an effective media strategy to appeal for information and witnesses in order to help identify and bring to justice a perpetrator if media organisations cannot publish the victim’s name, picture or any meaningful detail about the case or circumstances if there is a risk that that detail might lead to identification. There is a real risk that this lack of context and information may mean that members of the public who possess information of significance to the investigation may not even know this information is in their possession.</p>
                    <p>The police often work with families to publicise crimes in the pursuit of justice. Anonymity would significantly impact the amount of media coverage given to a case - and the effectiveness of that coverage. The media would be diminished as a powerful tool in such cases.</p>
                    <p>… An anonymity extension is likely to diminish the number of people who will listen or take interest in a police appeal for information relating to an anonymous victim. Not through a lack of compassion but through unknowingly having been deprived of context, connection, commentary, and responsible media analysis. ” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>Some respondents referred to situations that start as a missing child case, with widespread publicity to aid the search, but then develop into homicide cases, and suggested that introducing reporting restrictions at that point could then impede the police in gathering further information from potential witnesses.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents, particularly individuals who had been bereaved, did not believe an extension of anonymity to child homicide victims would impact on the ability of the police to investigate and referred to examples of anonymity in other types of case or for other individuals, for example where the accused is a child or for child victims of sexual offences.</p>
                    <p>Other respondents suggested that there are things that could be done to ensure that any extension of anonymity does not interfere with the ability of the police to investigate such as providing an exemption to restrictions for this purpose. When considering if information should be released, some respondents suggested that a balance must be struck between the potential benefit to the investigation and the potential harm to those bereaved and that the police are already adept at dealing with these sensitive decisions in other types of cases.</p>
                    <p>“Ensuring that police can continue to fulfil their functions is crucial, but we do not believe the proposed changes would impact on this. There are existing arrangements for example in respect of missing person cases that can be built upon, as well as existing guidelines and processes for Police Scotland liaising with families to agree communication strategies, as well as Police Scotland working with <abbr title="Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service">COPFS</abbr> regarding the publication of information in criminal investigations. Whilst there may be risks, for example that a child identified previously as a missing person would be identified should the case develop into a homicide investigation, these risks exist currently for example where a missing person case develops into a criminal investigation where that individual is now a victim. These risks would appear to be unavoidable.” - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>Some victim support organisations specifically raised missing person cases, where the name of a child might be shared while they are missing but when they are found alive, the name has then been retrospectively redacted from media coverage due to criminality involving sexual offences:</p>
                    <p>“We believe the same approach can and should apply in cases where the child dies as a result of crime, regardless of whether or not there is a sexual element. This also demonstrates the ability to limit the widespread identification of the victim and their family by the general public outside of the local community.</p>
                    <p>It is important to highlight that the identity of children who are victims of a sexual crimes are protected and it is not considered that this impedes police investigations. Further, media outlets do not report on sexual crimes where incest is involved. We believe that if the Police can successfully investigate sexual crimes while protecting anonymity, the same can be done for child homicide cases.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>Some respondents did not offer a direct view on this issue as they thought the Police were best placed to answer this.</p>
                    <h4>Freedom of expression</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 5: Do you consider that an extension to anonymity would have an impact on freedom of expression? Please provide details.</strong></p>
                    <p>29 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Other respondents addressed this issue in comments made throughout their response.</p>
                    <p>The impact an extension of anonymity would have on freedom of expression was a significant concern for all media organisation respondents with some warning that it could be legally challengeable as non-compliant with Articles 8 (right to respect for private and family life) and 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘<abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>’).</p>
                    <p>Other respondents expressed concerns specifically about the impact if anonymity was introduced with no option to waive.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, some respondents, primarily those who had been bereaved, indicated they did not think there would be an impact on freedom of expression and stressed the importance of protecting the family.</p>
                    <p>Many respondents raised that an extension of anonymity would not only restrict the freedom of expression of the media but would also directly impact individuals, including those that had been bereaved, from talking publicly about their loss (covered in more detail in the section above on bereaved talking about loss).</p>
                    <p>“It is a fundamental error in thinking about and stress-testing proposals in this area to think that free expression is primarily or exclusively the preserve of a sometimes intrusive media. Reporting restrictions affect not only broadcasters and national publishers, but also ordinary people, including bereaved families and friends.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>Although the majority of respondents that addressed this issue stated that an extension of anonymity would have an impact on freedom of expression, many noted that this is a qualified right and that restrictions to it can be justified in some circumstances.</p>
                    <p>“it is important to remember, that the right to freedom of expression, as provided for in the European Convention on Human Rights (<abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>) and the Human Rights Act 1998, is not unqualified. As the <abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>, Art.10(2) makes clear, lawful and proportionate encroachment on the right is permissible in certain limited circumstances and those that are particularly applicable here are the prevention of (another) crime and public safety. As is discussed in the Consultation Paper, freedom of expression is already curtailed in other contexts. Thus, while freedom of expression would be impacted by the reforms under discussion, that is no reason to rule them out.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>The need to balance competing rights, particularly freedom of expression and privacy, in order to determine if an encroachment on them is appropriate was commonly raised. Many respondents raised that to be justified, an intrusion on freedom of expression must be proportionate, with any restriction of the right being the least intrusive possible, and should only be introduced to prevent worse harms.</p>
                    <p>“There is a balancing exercise to be struck between protecting the vulnerable, especially other children who are caught up in these tragedies, and ensuring that the media can play its essential role by reporting on matters of public interest. Responsibility for deciding how to strike this balance is ultimately a matter for the Scottish Government, but it is clear that the proposed extension would represent a very significant change to the existing position, with uncertain impacts. Preventing the publication of material identifying the victim would seriously constrain reporting and the freedom of family members and the wider community to communicate with each other about what happened for an indeterminate amount of time.” – Independent Press Standards Organisation</p>
                    <p>“It is our position that it is not a robust response to legislate where the statistical basis for intervention remains so small (even although the subject matter may be heart rending) when contrasted against the significantly increased restriction on freedom of expression envisaged by such change.” – Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>Some media organisations also raised in their responses that an extension of anonymity could cause media outlets to “err on the side of caution” in their reporting of such cases and would therefore have a “chilling effect” on the media.</p>
                    <p>However, other respondents raised that anonymity of deceased child victims would only prevent the name of the child being covered and would not prevent general reporting of the case so would not meaningfully limit the media’s freedom of expression. Some noted that this already successfully happens for victims of sexual offences.</p>
                    <p>“Anonymity is extended in other legal arenas such as to victims of rape due to the impact on victims and their families. Children who have been murdered and their families are likewise victims. Restrictions on freedom of expression can be justified in the face of potential harm to others, but should be carefully balanced decision taken by skilled and experienced professionals. In our view, this is not a simple tick list decision however. It requires skilled and experienced risk assessment as to the risks of harm and thoughtful liaison with the families of the victim.” – Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>“The media would still be able to report on cases of child homicide, just not identify the victim. This allows the public interest to be served whilst maintaining the privacy and dignity of the victim and their family. The media already anonymously reports on sexual crimes (<abbr title="Independent Press Standards Organisation">IPSO</abbr>, 2021), which is evidence that this practice can be extended to child homicide cases.</p>
                    <p>… Media representatives warn of the ‘chilling effect’ this measure may have on reporting. We do not accept this assertion. We firmly believe it is still possible to report on child homicide cases while ensuring the anonymity of the victim.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <h4>Whose rights are being protected</h4>
                    <p>Some respondents raised the importance of being clear on whose rights are being protected when considering the extension of anonymity to child victims of homicide and which are the priority: those of the deceased child, surviving child siblings, other family members, the general public or the media.</p>
                    <p>“Rights and principles like freedom of expression, privacy, public interest and open justice will always require to be balanced in decision making. Like most decisions regarding reporting restrictions there are balances to be struck, often balances that are highly case specific. We need to consider whose freedom of expression and privacy is the priority here - that of the deceased victim, their next of kin and surviving relatives, or of those who are publicly identifying the child, including media outlets? We also need to consider the differing motivations for such expression and that these motivations may change. Within these considerations, the contested concept of public interest is important” - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>Many respondents throughout their response referred to the protection of fundamental rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (<abbr title="European  Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (<abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child">UNCRC</abbr>), with a range of views on whose rights should be protected and prioritised. Some also referred to the Scottish Government’s commitment to ‘<a href="https://www.gov.scot/policies/girfec/">getting it right for every child</a>’ (<abbr title="Getting it Right for Every Child">GIRFEC</abbr>).</p>
                    <p>Comparisons were made by many respondents with the rights and protections for a child perpetrator and those, or lack of, for a deceased child victim. It was often suggested, particularly by individuals who had been bereaved, that upon death the child victim loses rights, and comparisons were also drawn with the anonymity of surviving victims of sexual abuse.</p>
                    <p>“I believe that victims under the age of 18 who die as a result of crime should be given the same rights and protections as a living victim under the age of 18 who is the victim of another crime, for example sexual abuse or assault.</p>
                    <p>… The current legislation in Scotland gives anonymity to perpetrators in Scotland who are under the age of 18, we are not asking too much. Why should victims not be given the same right when they are killed as a result of a crime?” – individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p>“However I believe there should be a law protecting the confidentiality of the child victim. The poor child deserves to still have rights especially as the right to live has been taken away from them. Not giving them this dignity as we would in life means we are saying they don't matter anymore. You can understand why its hard for victims families to witness how many rights the perpetrator has. No one protects the victim and in turn the family.” - individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p>“Where there is a crime with a sexual element and the child also dies as a result of that crime, then the child loses their right to anonymity. This results in details of a crime being made available that would not have been disclosed if the child had survived. Families tell us this feels particularly dehumanising and disrespectful (Victim Support Scotland, 2024b).</p>
                    <p>… We are opposed to child victims losing rights they would otherwise have because they are a victim of homicide.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>However, one respondent disagreed with the view that child homicide victims lose rights to anonymity on death, as the statutory restrictions currently available to victims of other crimes (including orders under section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and section 27 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995) are discretionary and do not automatically apply to all children in all circumstances.</p>
                    <p>“For this reason, it is not a correct statement of the current law that child victims lose anonymity rights enjoyed by other children involved in the criminal justice process. As currently framed, the 1995 Act currently only protects some children from publicity in connection with criminal cases, and then only from traditional broadcasters and publications.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>Other respondents, mainly from media organisations, suggested that the rights under discussion, particularly privacy, do not continue after death:</p>
                    <p>“If this is analysed as being a right owed to the dignity of the victim, that would be a startling change to the Scottish legal system’s approach to the consequences of death… It is a general legal principle that an individual’s privacy and reputational rights fall away upon death and are not transferable to others.” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>One respondent went on to explain that although the privacy rights of the deceased are not protected, European case law indicates that the rights of surviving family members are:</p>
                    <p>“…it is not the deceased’s right to privacy which is therefore protected, but how the reputation of the deceased member impacts on the private life of surviving family members, which can include siblings… While it remains the case that it is not the deceased person who is centred in the case, but the rights of their surviving relatives, it does seem that there has been a shift towards more extensive protection in recent case law which should factor into the analysis of this proposal in human rights terms.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>Many respondents referred to the rights of the surviving family, particularly child siblings, to have a private, family life. The impact of media coverage on surviving child siblings more generally is covered above at page 12.</p>
                    <p>The rights of surviving children was discussed in detail particularly in responses from children’s organisations and victims support organisations. Key points raised were:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>“The rights and views of surviving siblings should be paramount in decisions.” – Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</li>
                     <li>although there is a balancing of rights to freedom of expression and privacy for all surviving family members, regardless of age, the right to privacy of a child is likely to be stronger due to their inherent vulnerability</li>
                     <li>children also have additional rights and protections under the <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child">UNCRC</abbr>:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>“The <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child">UNCRC</abbr>, in Article 37, provides an obligation on the State to “take all appropriate measures to promote the physical and psychological recovery…” of child victims. Surviving siblings should be regarded as secondary victims” – Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland</p>
                    <p>However, some respondents did not think that the age of the bereaved should be the main indicator of the need for anonymity and that a more nuanced approach would be necessary:</p>
                    <p>“It may be more appropriate to use the circumstances of the loss, rather than age of siblings, to inform whether anonymity is appropriate in a particular instances. Age of children is not the defining indicator of their capacity to understand. More important is the support they have from their parents, other caregivers, schools and peer group. Withholding information from children due to perceptions of age can cause long term harm, affecting relationships in the years to come. Children need honest information that they can trust, digest and emotionally process. Parents and siblings should get the professional support they need to navigate this very difficult stage within their loss and grief.” – Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>One respondent noted that there could be implications for children’s rights more generally and these must be taken into consideration:</p>
                    <p>“The implications for children, including surviving siblings, but also other children who may be involved in a child’s death, including witnesses, other non-deceased victims, and any child suspect/accused, need to be fully considered. A child rights and wellbeing impact assessment will be required.” – Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <h4>Open justice</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 6: Do you consider that an extension to anonymity would have an impact on open justice? Please provide details</strong></p>
                    <p>29 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Other respondents addressed this issue in comments made throughout their response.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that thought an extension to anonymity would have a significant negative impact on open justice,<a href="jxxxxxx-xx.htm"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the majority were media organisations. Terms commonly used to show the strength of feeling on this included: “a serious restriction to”, “a major encroachment on”, “antithetical to” and “detrimental to” the principle of open justice:</p>
                    <p>“For journalists and the public, anonymity is probably the most intrusive of all restrictions. To anonymise the dead victim of an indictable crime of the utmost gravity would, substantially, eviscerate open justice. Leaving aside the very large overlap between familial relationship and criminal guilt in child homicide cases, permanently to conceal the identity of any victim of unlawful killing is starkly antithetical to open justice.” - <abbr>DC</abbr> Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd</p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised that as the perpetrators of child homicides are most commonly parents, in these cases the perpetrator would also have to be afforded anonymity due to the risk of jigsaw identification. This was seen to compound the impact anonymity for child homicide victims would have on open justice.</p>
                    <p>Others offered explanation as to what they understood open justice to mean and the role the media play in it.</p>
                    <p>“For most people, open justice means understanding a court case and its outcomes. The platform for doing this is media reporting. Media reporting is based on telling human stories that connect with audiences. Anonymity in such important cases will significantly restrict the level and quality of reporting and reduce the amount of people who know about a case and how justice was served.</p>
                    <p>Transparency and reporting of criminal cases is key to ensure that perpetrators and those involved in enforcing the law are held to account. This is vital to improve public confidence in the justice system.” - <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>“Generally, the work of the courts must be accessible to the public. Very few members of the public are in a position to attend at a court to observe proceedings and, whilst sentencing statements and judgments are published on <abbr title="Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service">SCTS</abbr> websites, the principal conduit of information about court cases is the media.” – Senators of the College of Justice</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that thought an extension to anonymity would not impact on open justice, it was often raised that anonymity would not prevent the cases from being reported on. Some respondents also referred to examples of anonymity for other individuals and case types including where the accused is under 18 and also victims of sexual offences.</p>
                    <p>“We do not believe that these changes will fundamentally impact on open justice. Justice will still be seen to be served and cases will still be able to be reported on, just without information that identifies the child and therefore in a manner that affords greater protection to deceased children and their families.</p>
                    <p>We recognise the challenges of jigsaw identification and that these changes could inevitably mean parents who murder their child are not identified. However, this could be beneficial to any other surviving siblings, avoiding the potential stigma these children could experience. There will also be learning from approaches in other cases involving child victims where offences are committed by a family member who benefit from reporting restrictions for example cases of incest.” – Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>“The Consultation Paper refers to open justice requiring court proceedings to be open to the public and transparency in reporting on criminal cases and these are important aspects of it. However, that does not mean that the public is – or needs to be – entitled to know about every aspect of every case. In short, a distinction can be drawn between there being a “public interest” is having certain information and (the more prurient members of) the public simply “being interested”.</p>
                    <p>… The sort of restrictions under discussion would prevent naming deceased child victims, publishing photographs of them or reporting information that might reasonably lead to their identification. These restrictions would not prevent reporting of the fact that the crime had been committed, the essence of it (nature of the crime, geographic location, details of suspects and so forth), the police investigation or legal proceedings relating to it.” - individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>Other respondents noted that, like freedom of expression, constraints and restrictions to open justice can be justified and referred to factors to be taken in to consideration including harm to family members and the public interest (covered in more detail below).</p>
                    <p>“It is important to acknowledge that open justice is not without constraints and restrictions… The media are accustomed to operating within court-imposed restrictions. If anonymity for child victims is implemented, this would be a small restriction for the press but would make coverage of the case significantly less distressing to the family and surviving siblings.” - Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <h4>Public interest</h4>
                    <p>There were no specific questions on public interest in the consultation paper. However, this was a theme that came up often in responses, particularly in relation to freedom of expression and open justice.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents, particularly media organisations, were of the view that transparent reporting on child homicide cases, including the name of the victim, is in the public interest.</p>
                    <p>“… child homicide is one of the most disturbing crimes to rend the social fabric and to engage the public interest in its public prosecution.” – Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>“To report accurately the essentials of what happens in a public court is a matter of definitive public interest, not a proprietary private right.” - <abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr> Scotland</p>
                    <p>“The truth matters. Facts prevents fake news, rumours and speculation to proliferate online uncorrected and there is a public interest in transparency when a death occurs. The death of an individual is not an entirely private matter.” – <abbr title="Independent Television News">ITN</abbr></p>
                    <p>However, other respondents raised that there is a difference between what is in the public interest and what the public are interested in, and that they are not entitled to know every detail in the name of public interest, with some victim support organisations also calling for more robust tests to evaluate what is in the public interest.</p>
                    <p>Other comments suggested that the public interest is one factor to be weighed up in considering a number of competing rights including freedom of expression, privacy and open justice and that the balance will vary case to case.</p>
                    <p>“Rights and principles like freedom of expression, privacy, public interest and open justice will always require to be balanced in decision making. Like most decisions regarding reporting restrictions there are balances to be struck, often balances that are highly case specific... Within these considerations, the contested concept of public interest is important” - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>“An extension to anonymity could have an impact on open justice, as it would restrict reporting on investigations into persons suspected of causing a child death if their identity could lead to the child being identified. This may be justifiable on occasions where the public interest is outweighed by potential harm to wider family members were the circumstances of the child death to become public knowledge. Each case will be different and require a nuanced and skilled approach to making these decision which is why we think blanket legislation is not the answer that families need.” - Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <h4>Public understanding and education</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 15: To what extent do you think it is important that the wider public understand anonymity provisions?</strong></p>
                    <p>29 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p>The majority of respondents that responded to this question thought if anonymity provisions were introduced then wider public understanding of the provisions would be of high importance, particularly as breach of the provisions would be a criminal offence resulting in a penalty.</p>
                    <p>Other respondents also highlighted that many individuals may not recognise that their own use of social media would be covered by any anonymity provisions, not just traditional forms of media, and if due to this lack of understanding they were to share prohibited information online this would risk undermining the restrictions.</p>
                    <p>“In general it is important that the wider public understand anonymity provisions however, this is a complex area of law which private individuals may not associate with their own use of social media, for example, believing that posting as a private individual to a group of friends and acquaintances does not present a breach of anonymity. If the intention is to criminalise breaches of anonymity, it is essential that the wider public have easily available, easily understood explanations of anonymity provisions.” – Scottish Association of Social Work</p>
                    <p>One respondent commented that without public understanding of any extension of anonymity there would be a risk that this “could give rise to confusion and suspicion, with the perverse outcome that trust in outlets behaving responsibly – by complying with the law – could be damaged. Such misunderstanding and speculation can lay the ground for misinformation and suggestions of a “cover-up”.” – Independent Press Standards Organisation</p>
                    <p>A small number of respondents also suggested that if the public were to understand the anonymity provisions and reasons for them, this may reduce the expectation of, and demand for, extensive details in these cases.</p>
                    <p>Although many thought wider public understanding of anonymity provisions was crucial, a number of respondents suggested this would be challenging with some even stating it would be impossible.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents, mainly individuals who had been bereaved, did not think public understanding of anonymity provisions was important. This was confirmed in responses from some victim support organisations who, although they did see value in wider public understanding, reported that:</p>
                    <p>“Families bereaved by crime tell us that they do not consider that the public at large necessarily need to understand anonymity provisions. This is because families, staff and volunteers do not generally view the wider public as being responsible for the harm they have experienced (Victim Support Scotland, 2024b). Families say that the key groups who need to understand the measures are:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>The bereaved families themselves,</li>
                     <li>The media,</li>
                     <li>Victim support organisations,</li>
                     <li>Police Family Liaison Officers,</li>
                     <li>Other agencies in the criminal justice system.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Question 16: What can be done to increase public understanding of anonymity provisions?</strong></p>
                    <p>26 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p>A wide range of suggestions were received from respondents as to what can be done to increase public understanding of anonymity provisions including:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>a widespread public awareness campaign and communications strategy including leaflets and social media</li>
                     <li>bespoke information produced for those who have been bereaved, those that support them and for the media</li>
                     <li>including a statement on media articles explaining why the victim has not been named and encouraging the public not to speculate on the identity of the victim or share details on social media</li>
                     <li>sharing examples of what is permitted by law and what is not</li>
                     <li>sharing lived experience of bereaved families and the impact coverage has had on them</li>
                     <li>keeping the legislation as simple and easy to understand as possible and also consistent/aligned with other provisions relating to anonymity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>One respondent suggested this was part of the wider challenge of public legal education and suggested that much more should be done to tackle that including mandatory legal education in schools and stated that “part of the challenge here is that that (inexplicably) many members of the public do not seem to find law interesting until it affects them.” – individual, legal professional</p>
                    <p>Another respondent suggested that the money from financial penalties for breach of anonymity provisions could be used to “educate people on the harm their words cause to the victims family” – individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <p><strong>Question 17: What group of people do you think it would be hardest to educate about anonymity provisions?</strong></p>

                    <h4>Enforcement of anonymity and social media</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 22: To what extent do you think that the legislative options proposed are proportionate and enforceable? Please give reasons for your answer.</strong></p>
                    <p>Respondents were asked to what extent they thought the four options put forward in the consultation paper were proportionate and enforceable. These were:</p>
                    <p>1. No anonymity restrictions (i.e. the status quo) but with non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit</p>
                    <p>2. Full anonymity restrictions (no waiver)</p>
                    <p>3. Automatic anonymity with option to waive</p>
                    <p>4. No automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit)</p>
                    <p>As will be shown in more detail below, the majority that responded to this question disagreed that full anonymity restrictions with no waiver (19 out of 23) and no automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (16 out of 23) are proportionate and enforceable options. Views on the proportionality of the status quo with non-legislative actions and no automatic anonymity but can apply for a court order were more mixed.</p>

                    <p>Of the 23 respondents that provided an answer to this question 3 either agreed or strongly agreed, 4 neither agreed or disagreed, and 16 either disagreed or strongly disagreed that no automatic anonymity but can apply for court order (with the potential for non-legislative actions, such as a media toolkit<em>) </em>was a proportionate and enforceable option.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents commented that this option placed a disproportionate burden on bereaved family members at a time they are grieving.</p>
                    <p>There was a consensus in the responses from media organisations that none of the legislative options proposed were “necessary or proportionate”. Comments included:</p>
                    <p>“It is a disproportionate and impractical move, and the inevitable difficulties it would encounter and anomalies it would create could lead to even more draconian restrictions.” – Newsbrands Scotland</p>
                    <p>“thankfully the position remains that the level of child homicide remains at a very low level. It is our position that it is not a robust response to legislate where the statistical basis for intervention remains so small (even although the subject matter may be heart rending) when contrasted against the significantly increased restriction on freedom of expression envisaged by such change. – Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>“Given it will be impossible to police social media activity, in practice it will only be reputable media outlets that will be prevented from reporting and publishing information related to such cases. This may add to unfounded theories of media cover-up and will allow misinformation to go unchallenged by traditional news providers. This is dangerous and risks a significant negative social impact.</p>
                    <p>Anonymity measures will not necessarily stop certain activities raised by families bereaved by crime as a cause for concern. They will not stop people approaching family members, nor questions being asked, nor will they stop distressing posts on social platforms.” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p><strong>Question 14: What do you think are the main challenges to enforcing anonymity restrictions?</strong></p>
                    <p>30 respondents provided an answer to this question directly.</p>
                    <p>The most commonly raised theme was social media.</p>
                    <p>A large number of comments from respondents also raised a lack of public knowledge of the law and the risk of criminalising those with good intentions as challenges to enforcing anonymity restrictions</p>
                    <p>Some respondents also raised cross-border issues, this is covered in more detail below from page 57.</p>
                    <h4>Social media</h4>
                    <p>Many respondents, from across all respondent types, highlighted the difficulty in monitoring social media content and enforcing any restrictions particularly as it is not often clear or easy to establish who the “publisher” of such information is. It was often raised in responses from media organisations that it would not be appropriate to have a “two tier system” in which mainstream/traditional media was restricted but social media was not with some suggesting that the content online and on social media is often more problematic than what is covered in traditional media.</p>
                    <p>The ease and speed at which information can be circulated and shared on social media, and the difficulty in getting content removed from platforms once it has been posted, was commonly raised. Some respondents also noted that as the mainstream/traditional media outlets would be restricted they could not then correct any misinformation that may be circulated online.</p>
                    <p>“Social media has made a difference. It is very difficult to police and it is instant. Information about something that has happened locally can now be circulated whilst an incident is happening – or whilst emergency services provide a response. With or without actual reporting local knowledge of an incident, particularly a serious incident will spread. Sometimes without mainstream reporting the detail of an incident can be distorted and can become the ‘truth’ that is heard by a community. This can also be very damaging and mainstream reporting might need to be used to quash or quell the rumour mill.” - Scottish Children’s Reporter Administration</p>
                    <p>“the media would be prevented from acting as a trusted news provider as it would be unable to “set the record straight” where fake news, unsubstantiated rumours and accusations are free to spread through social media without accountability.” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>“It may also have the unintended effect of restraining responsible actors from correcting misinformation or misunderstandings” – Independent Press Standards Organisation</p>
                    <p>However some respondents, particularly victim support organisations, while recognising the challenges with social media, suggested that often the content online has stemmed from something that has been published by traditional media. They were also of the view that that the challenges with social media should not be a reason not to regulate other coverage:</p>
                    <p>“Whilst it may be tempting to view traditional media coverage and social media content as two distinct issues, families tell us that social media content that traumatises the family often originates from publications by traditional media outlets<em>… </em>it would be wrong to let the perfect be the enemy of the good and opt not to regulate press coverage just because it is deemed too difficult to regulate social media.<em>” </em>– Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>One bereaved individual suggested that content online would not be so problematic if fewer details about the crime were released in the first instance:</p>
                    <p>“Some would slip under the net but if details were instantly kept confidential they would not have much to report on regarding details. These for example cause of death, injuries ect should be sealed.” – individual, bereaved family member or friend</p>
                    <h4>Lack of public knowledge and over-criminalisation</h4>
                    <p>A large number of comments from respondents suggested that, should anonymity provisions be introduced, a lack of public knowledge of them and understanding of how they applied could be challenging for their enforcement as it could result in a great deal of information being online and on social media and therefore “any anonymity law would be more honoured in the breach”. – Newsbrands Scotland</p>
                    <p>However, other respondents suggested this could be remedied by awareness raising and education. This is covered in more detail in the section above on public understanding and education.</p>
                    <p>Linked to this, some respondents raised that many breaches of anonymity provisions are likely to be committed by those acting with good intentions, for example those who have been impacted by the loss of the child paying respects on social media and their criminalisation is not in the interests of anyone.</p>
                    <p>One respondent highlighted that anonymity provisions may have a disproportionate impact on children and young people as the dominant users of social media.</p>
                    <p>Children and young people could be disproportionately impacted by such changes as they are high users of online/social media platforms, are more likely to be peers or siblings of child homicide victims, and are still developing and going through intense physiological, emotional and cognitive change (see O'Rourke et al, 2020, literature review submitted to the Scottish Sentencing Council). The negative consequences of criminalisation are well established, and children should be protected from this as far as possible. – Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>To counter this, some respondents suggested that those who breach anonymity provisions and are acting in a professional capacity or in a position of trust should be held to a higher standard and face more serious consequences.</p>
                    <h4>Penalties</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 19: What do you think would be an appropriate penalty for breaching an anonymity restriction?</strong></p>
                    <p>28 respondents provided an answer to this question.</p>
                    <p>The most commonly suggested penalty for breaching an anonymity restriction was a fine. Some respondents suggested that this should be higher for media organisations than for individual members of the public and supported similar penalties to those proposed under the Victims, Witnesses, and Justice Reform (Scotland) Bill.<a href="jxxxxxx-xx.htm"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Further comments suggested that any financial penalty should be large enough to act as a deterrent to large media organisations who may have larger resources.</p>
                    <p>“The use of maximum penalties allows the judiciary to make decisions based on the circumstances of the case but addresses the current issues that penalties set at the current low levels may be seen as a “risk worth taking” when compared with the benefits for the individual or organisation involved, be this through sales revenue or social media/online presence.” - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>There were some suggestions from respondents as to what the money raised by fines for breaches should be used for including: used to educate people on the impact of the breach and added to the Victims Surcharge Fund to be used to support families bereaved by crime.</p>
                    <p>Other suggestions for appropriate penalties included: loss of internet use, community service, confiscation of profits from stories in breach to then be given to bereaved family, and civil recourse/ a right to sue for the bereaved family.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents raised concerns about the criminalisation of the general public, particularly children and those who have been bereaved, who may be well intentioned and therefore suggested that intention would be an important consideration.</p>
                    <p>“This is a complicated area. Provisions already exist in law for fines or potential imprisonment for breach of reporting restrictions. The application of this to the general public would depend of the facts of each case. As noted above, anonymity restrictions could criminalise schoolfriends paying tribute on social media. The effects of this may be as damaging as a deliberate leak by an adult aware of the legal constraints, but it may not be in the interests of justice or policing to seek to criminalise children in this way.” - National Union of Journalists</p>
                    <p>“We are concerned about the range of people who could be penalised for breaching restrictions, particularly family members who are grieving and for whom publicly sharing information about their loved ones could be an important part of the grieving process. We also recognise members of the public or community who may be impacted by the child’s death and publicly share well intentioned information could be at risk of being criminalised, underlining the importance of developing understanding of provisions. We think understanding the intent behind sharing information will be important when penalties are being considered and proportionality of response... We wonder if there could be a greater focus on penalties for organisations who breach restrictions, including social media platforms where information is shared, or penalties in terms of fines being proportionate to income/ revenue raised from the publication of such information for individuals or organisations, which could be higher than the current maximum penalties.” – Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
                    <p>Other respondents did not think there should be any new restrictions and therefore there should be no penalties.</p>
                    <h4>Cross-border application</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question 20: To what extent do you agree that any extension of anonymity to deceased child victims in Scotland would need to apply to the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to be effective?</strong></p>

                    </table>
                    <p>27 respondents answered this question, with a majority (20) stating that they ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’. 6 respondents ‘neither agreed nor disagreed’ and only one ‘strongly disagreed’.</p>
                    <p>Of those respondents that agreed that any extension of anonymity to deceased child victims in Scotland would need to apply to the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to be effective, the general view was that otherwise any provisions would be “unmanageable and completely ineffective” and “virtually impossible to implement and impose”.</p>
                    <p>Some media organisations commented that anonymity provisions that did not apply <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide “would create a highly fragmented approach to news reporting in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, creating confusion for families and communities and leading to bizarre scenarios where families in Scotland can talk about their grief to an English broadcaster, but not a Scottish broadcaster.” – Scottish Media Lawyers Society (and associated campaign plus responses)</p>
                    <p>It was often raised by respondents that the proximity of the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> would mean that the identity of a victim, anonymised only in Scotland, would be easily accessible both physically in printed media and through online national media outlets which would negate the effectiveness of any reporting restrictions.</p>
                    <p>“Otherwise, a situation could arise where an English-based broadcaster could name a child homicide victim in Scottish proceedings, but a Scottish-based broadcaster could not. Without application <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-wide, the provisions will not achieve the desired outcomes. They would prevent trusted Scottish news publishers and broadcasters from responsible reporting, but audiences would still have full access to the story on multiple online platforms as provided by media companies based elsewhere in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.” – <abbr title="Scottish Television">STV</abbr> Group <abbr title="Public Limited Company">PLC</abbr></p>
                    <p>Respondents also commonly raised that news is not restricted by geographical boundaries due to the availability of news and information online through both online media outlets and social media.</p>
                    <p>Some respondents from media organisations also highlighted the operational difficulties and impracticalities that having different rules in different <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> jurisdictions would have for national media outlets:</p>
                    <p>“Further from a national news perspective it would be totally impractical producing different reports on national television and online. It does not reflect the reality of how information flows in the modern world” - <abbr title="Independent Television News">ITN</abbr></p>
                    <p>“Leaving aside the issue of the internet, the same content is often published, for example, sister titles Daily Record and The Mirror, or The Scottish Sun and The Sun. To have separate stories in separate editions is ineffective. Broadcast media does not follow the Scottish border: <abbr title="Independent Television">ITV</abbr> Border, for example, covers both. Full anonymity will be almost impossible to enforce and would be very expensive to police.” - National Union of Journalists</p>
                    <p>Some respondents noted that if the Scottish Government did want anonymity provisions to extend to the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, this would require a section 104 order under the Scotland Act and for this agreement from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Government would be crucial.</p>
                    <p>Other respondents, although of the view that extension to the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> would be necessary to be workable, commented that the effectiveness would be limited as non-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> media outlets could still publish identifying information.</p>
                    <p>However, some victim support organisations although in favour of extending any anonymity provisions <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> wide, were not of the view that restrictions in Scotland alone would be ineffective. They suggested that this would still be an improvement and could still reduce the re-traumatisation for bereaved families.</p>
                    <p>“Even if <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> media outlets do not report anonymously outwith Scotland, <abbr title="Victim Support Scotland">VSS</abbr> believes this would still improve reporting standards within Scotland, by reducing the number of triggering articles families are exposed to. Additionally, the less traction a story gets initially, as well being less geographically relevant, the less likely it is to be picked up by other news sources. Families impacted by crime often tell us that it is local media outlets that are most likely to report the story for years after the fact, on anniversaries of the death, the child’s birthday and when there is an update for the perpetrator (Victim Support Scotland, 2024b). Anonymising coverage of child homicide, even at a local level, would mitigate the situation and support the family’s wellbeing.” – Victim Support Scotland and Victims Organisations Collaboration Forum Scotland</p>
                    <p>Some individuals who have been bereaved and victim support organisations stated that if Scotland were to extend anonymity for child victims of homicide, other jurisdictions may then follow suit.</p>
                    <p>Another concern relating to jurisdiction was raised by some media organisations. They questioned what would determine if Scottish anonymity provisions would apply – would it be related to the location of the offence or the domicile of the victim.</p>

                    <p>In response to this question, many media organisations re-iterated their view that the options involving automatic anonymity would be very likely to result in a successful legal challenge, on the basis that they encroached excessively on open justice.</p>

                     <li>a piecemeal approach to legislating for reporting restrictions in Scotland should be avoided with references made to provisions that were in the Children’s (Care and Justice) Bill and are currently in the Victims, Witnesses and Justice Reform (Scotland) Bill)</li>
                     <li>provisions relating to reporting restrictions removed from the Children’s (Care and Justice) Bill at Stage 3 should be reconsidered, and strengthening reporting restrictions for a child accused could address some of the issues explored in this consultation:</li>

Additionally, some of the graphic details in relation to an offence and a victim that can be publicly documented when a child accused appeals their sentence could only be anonymously reported should these changes apply to child accused, which would further benefit child victims, including deceased victims, and their families. “ - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>

                    <h4>Small number of cases</h4>
                    <p>The thankfully small number of child homicide cases in Scotland was commonly raised by respondents, across all types, throughout consultation responses. Some respondents referred to this as a reason why such crimes draw so much attention:</p>
                    <p>“Precisely because of the merciful rarity of childhood mortality and child homicide, curiosity and concern are understandable human reactions in any community confronting this kind of situations.

                    <p>However, some victim support organisations expressed concerns, on behalf of those bereaved, that this is “often cited as a justification for increased public interest, and by extension, media attention”.</p>
                    <p>Many responses from media organisations stated that the small number of cases was a specific reason not to legislate for anonymity as this would be a disproportionate response.</p>
                    <h4>Case examples</h4>
                    <p>Many respondents, in order to put their views in context, referred to specific cases of child homicide. These have not been referred to directly in this analysis to avoid re-traumatisation of bereaved familes who may read this report. However, the variety of case examples given do illustrate the wide range of circumstances in which child homicides take place and the complexities that are often involved.</p>

                    <p><strong>Question 24: Do you have any other comments on this issue that you would like to share with us?</strong></p>
                    <p>20 respondents provided an answer to this question directly. Many of the comments made have been addressed elsewhere in the report.</p>
                    <p>In response to this question, many media organisations re-iterated their view that the options involving automatic anonymity would be very likely to result in a successful legal challenge, on the basis that they encroached excessively on open justice.</p>
                    <p>Other comments included:</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>a piecemeal approach to legislating for reporting restrictions in Scotland should be avoided with references made to provisions that were in the Children’s (Care and Justice) Bill and are currently in the Victims, Witnesses and Justice Reform (Scotland) Bill)</li>
                     <li>provisions relating to reporting restrictions removed from the Children’s (Care and Justice) Bill at Stage 3 should be reconsidered, and strengthening reporting restrictions for a child accused could address some of the issues explored in this consultation:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>“for example “Particularly traumatising for bereaved families was the constant juxtaposition of their loved one’s picture alongside the person responsible for their death” (Roundtable on the end point for anonymity for child victims, p.4). Additionally, some of the graphic details in relation to an offence and a victim that can be publicly documented when a child accused appeals their sentence could only be anonymously reported should these changes apply to child accused, which would further benefit child victims, including deceased victims, and their families. “ - Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice</p>
