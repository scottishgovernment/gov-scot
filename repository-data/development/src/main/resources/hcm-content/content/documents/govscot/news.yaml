              <p>Health board boundaries will be aligned with local authority areas to help ensure older people can receive the care they need at home.<br /><br />Speaking today in parliament, Health Secretary Alex Neil revealed that catchment areas for health boards will be realigned with council boundaries, to help them work closer together in the provision of care in the local community.<br /><br />The announcement comes the week after a new bill designed to ensure that the health and social care systems work together effectively to improve the provision of care in our communities was published.<br /><br />Mr Neil said: <br /><br />&ldquo;People in Scotland are living longer, healthier lives and this means that services need to adapt in order to meet the challenges of a rapidly ageing population. <br /><br />&ldquo;That is why we are bringing health and social care together, to improve care for people in communities, helping to anticipate their needs and reaching them before they need to be admitted to hospital or institutional care.<br /><br />&ldquo;However, any mismatch of health board and local authority boundaries presents an administrative barrier to closer integrated working, complicating the planning and delivery of health and social care services.<br /><br />&ldquo;We want to ensure that the responsibility for delivering health care matches the geographical boundaries of local authority partners.<br /><br />&ldquo;These changes will help improve the quality and consistency of care for older people and people with complex care needs.&rdquo;<br /><br />The boundary changes will come into effect from April 2014.<br /><br />These are administrative changes and patients will stay with the same GP practice and continue to receive treatment in their local hospital, even if their catchment area has changed</p>

              taking forward the National Review of Town Centres includes a number

              include:</p><p></p><ul><li>A ‘town centre first’ principle whereby public
              bodies will consider how they can support town centres before considering
              development elsewhere</li><li>Working with housing providers to bring

              an independent panel of advisors from a range of organisations including

              Centre Management, Ernst and Young, GVA, Architecture Design Scotland,

              the report, Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure,
              Investment and Cities, Nicola Sturgeon said:</p><p>“I would like to
              extend my thanks to Malcolm Fraser and the rest of the external advisory
              group for their hard work and commitment on this report.</p><p>“The
              Scottish Government is determined to ensure that our town centres are
              vibrant places where local people and visitors alike want to spend their
              time and money. They should be accessible places which invite business
              start-ups and inspire innovative ideas from all walks of the community.  The
              work of this independent review will play a crucial role in the regeneration
              of high streets across Scotland.</p><p>“We recognise the national review
              group’s passion for finding a future for our town centres and welcome
              their succinct and insightful review which outlines practical ideas
              for reenergising these areas.</p><p>“Town centres are the lifeblood
              of our communities, functioning as places of social interaction and
              enterprise. By diversifying our high streets we will make them even
              better places to live, work and socialise.</p><p>“I look forward to
              the next phase of the work getting underway, with the first step being
              a government action plan in the autumn which will take forward the Expert
              Groups recommendation.” </p><p>Chairman of the National Review of Town
              Centres Malcolm Fraser said:</p><p>“Our Review offers the Scottish Government,
              and the people of Scotland, a range of measures to bring investment
              and footfall into the heart of our communities. </p><p>"Town centres
              offer a rich mix of live, work and play and we want to enhance that
              bustle and diversity: more people living there, encouragement for communities,
              businesses and local authorities and supportive planning and digital
              initiatives. There''s wide agreement on the need for action and optimism
              that the changes proposed can help foster a renewed sense of community
              and enterprise.” </p><p>Welcoming the report, Society of Chief Officers
              of Transportation in Scotland (SCOTS) Chairman, Ewan Wallace said:</p><p>"SCOTS
              welcomes the publication of the Town Centres Review report and the indication
              that the professional associations for Transportation and Planning will
              have a key role in contributing to any further work on town centre futures
              and planning for change.   </p><p>“The report highlights the critical
              role of effective and sustainable accessibility and connectivity in
              ensuring that our town centres are economically and socially vibrant
              places.  SCOTS has undertaken and contributed to a wide range of relevant
              policy and technical research and guidance, including Designing Streets
              and recent production of a  supporting Roads Development Guide.   </p><p>"We
              look forward to working with Scottish Government and other partners
              in developing these and other aspects of the Town Centres report and
              recommendations."</p><p>Commenting on the release of the Scottish Town
              Centre Review, Alasdair Morrison, Associate at GVA Property Consultancy
              and a member of the Scottish Government’s External Advisory Group for
              the National Review of Scottish Town Centres said:</p><p>“It has been
              a privilege to have had the opportunity to contribute in an advisory
              capacity to the Scottish Government’s National Review of Town Centres.
              I am pleased to see that the recommendations encourage the public sector,
              in particular, to take a more proactive and strategic approach. They
              have a vital role to play in regenerating our town centres.      </p><p>“However,
              new developments are often difficult to get off the ground, or stall,
              because of problems with development finance. The Review makes a number
              of recommendations in this respect. We now have an unprecedented opportunity
              for all interested parties to work together to ensure our town centres
              not only survive, but thrive.”</p><div class="notes-to-editors"><b>Notes
